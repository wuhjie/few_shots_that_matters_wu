en-000000001	Coalition strategy relied on establishing a number of patrol bases called Combat Operation Posts throughout the city.
en-000000002	U.S. military officers believe that insurgent actions during the battle led to the formation of the Anbar Awakening.
en-000000003	In response, Sunni sheiks banded together to drive insurgents from Ramadi.
en-000000004	In September 2006, Sheik Abdul Sattar Abu Risha formed the Anbar Salvation Council, an alliance of approximately 40 Sunni tribes.
en-000000005	U.S. Navy SEAL Michael A. Monsoor was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for actions during the battle.
en-000000006	On September 29, 2006, he threw himself upon a grenade which threatened the lives of the other members of his team.
en-000000007	Monsoor had previously been awarded the Silver Star in May for rescuing an injured comrade in the city.
en-000000008	The battle also marked the first use of chlorine bombs by insurgents during the war.
en-000000009	Since the fall of Fallujah in 2004, Ramadi had been the center of the insurgency in Iraq.
en-000000010	The Islamic State of Iraq, a front group for Al-Qaida in Iraq, had declared the city to be its capital.
en-000000011	Law and order had broken down, and street battles were common.
en-000000012	OP Virginia was the target of a heavily armed vehicle-born suicide bomber.
en-000000013	Insurgents with small arms and RPGs moved in on the post and a major firefight ensued.
en-000000014	The Marines of Lima Company, 3rd Battalion 8th Marines, eventually repelled the attack, killing dozens of insurgents with few Marine casualties.
en-000000015	Word of an offensive already gotten to the 400,000 citizens of the city who feared another Fallujah style attack.
en-000000016	On June 17, there were several skirmishes with the insurgents which killed two American soldiers.
en-000000017	The operation had some initial success but the effect that the Americans wanted to achieve did not happen.
en-000000018	Very soon the American forces were bogged down in heavy street fighting throughout the city.
en-000000019	Roadside bomb attacks and ambushes of patrols on the streets happened nearly every time the Marines went outside the wire.
en-000000020	Sniper attacks were also a constant threat to Marines during the battle.
en-000000021	They said wounded Iraqi police officers who had been taken to the hospital were later found beheaded.
en-000000022	They knocked down dozens of locked doors and searched medicine chests and storage closets for additional weapons.
en-000000023	Following this, 40 sheiks from 20 tribes from across Al Anbar organised a movement called the "Sahwa Al Anbar" (Anbar Awakening).
en-000000024	On September 9, Sheik Sittar organised a tribal council attended by over fifty sheiks and Col. Sean MacFarland.
en-000000025	Shortly after the council, the tribes began attacking al-Qaeda in Iraq insurgents in the suburbs of Ramadi.
en-000000026	By October, nearly every tribe in northern and western Ramadi had joined the awakening.
en-000000027	By December, attacks had dropped 50% according to the U.S. military.
en-000000028	In mid-September 2006, the 1st Battalion, 6th Marines (1-6) relieved the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines in western Ramadi.
en-000000029	The battalion commander, Lt. Col. Jurney, deployed his companies throughout the city.
en-000000030	Alpha Company was deployed to OP VA, a combat outpost close to a large seven-story building.
en-000000031	Interviews by an unnamed Los Angeles Times correspondent in Ramadi supported eyewitness statements that there were civilian deaths during the fighting.
en-000000032	News photos showed bodies of civilians allegedly killed by coalition forces.
en-000000033	At least one U.S. soldier was also killed in the fighting.
en-000000034	By mid-November at least 75 American soldiers and Marines were killed along with an unknown number of Iraqi soldiers and police.
en-000000035	Devlin was the chief Intelligence Officer for the Marine units operating in the province.
en-000000036	Insurgents still remained well entrenched in the city with coalition forces continuing combat operations throughout November and December.
en-000000037	On December 6, six American soldiers were killed in heavy street fighting.
en-000000038	By the end of the operation on January 14, 2007, US forces had killed 44 insurgents and captured a further 172.
en-000000039	Four additional Iraqi police stations were established during the operation, which brought the total to 14.
en-000000040	This operation was one of the closing engagements of the Battle of Ramadi in 2006.
en-000000041	Together with the Iraqi Army, the local police force began to conduct patrols with gradually lessened support from coalition forces.
en-000000042	The US and other coalition forces would have to withdraw gradually, beginning from the south of Iraq.
en-000000043	This led to the peaceful summer months of 2007, during which no attacks of any type took place.
en-000000044	In January 2007, Ramadi averaged approximately 35 enemy attacks on US forces per day.
en-000000045	1-18 operated out of the Ta'Meem district of Ramadi's western sector.
en-000000046	After several counter-insurgency operations, 3-69 AR Battalion effectively removed Al Qaeda in Iraq from the greater Anbar province.
en-000000047	Years later, by mid 2012, Ramadi remained far safer than it had been since 2003.
en-000000048	The following year he also became the first Organising Secretary of the South Pacific Commission.
en-000000049	He returned to the bar in 1948 to become one of Sydney's leading industrial lawyers.
en-000000050	Conlon himself took over ASOPA and spent 1948-49 as a reportedly unsuccessful and unhappy Principal of the institution.
en-000000051	In 1954, ASOPA began to train Australian teachers for service in TPNG to assist develop primary education.
en-000000052	At the same time, courses were offered to teachers recruited for Special (Aboriginal) Schools in the Northern Territory of Australia.
en-000000053	From 1956, teacher cadets were trained at distant Bathurst Teachers'College in Bathurst.
en-000000054	When the training course was eventually transferred to Middle Head in 1958, the trainee teachers were redesignated‘Cadet Education Officers'(CEOs).
en-000000055	In its final years, ASOPA introduced training for secondary teachers and more specialised administration courses.
en-000000056	The School enrolled up to 60 Papua New Guineans in ten-month management training courses.
en-000000057	At the same time, the training of Australians was phased out.
en-000000058	Although Papua New Guinea remained strongly represented, increasing numbers of students came from other developing countries in the Pacific and elsewhere.
en-000000059	ITI provided management training for professionals from developing countries in the Pacific, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.
en-000000060	The history of ASOPA, and its successor institutions, paralleled the changing political milieu of the post-war and cold war years.
en-000000061	ASOPA began as a training institution for Australians taking leadership positions in Australia's territories.
en-000000062	In its middle life, the School offered courses to people from developing countries.
en-000000063	At the same time, people from developing countries are more productive in a developed country.
en-000000064	And, at the end, it provided a base for Australians consulting to the developing world.
en-000000065	The program saw its first game in 1897 playing 7-on-7 basketball.
en-000000066	Throughout the years, the program had 1,370 wins and 1,218 losses (.529) with 7 NCAA appearances and 16 NIT appearances.
en-000000067	Nebraska's only major national trophy came when they won the 1996 NIT.
en-000000068	The head coach is currently Tim Miles who was hired on March 24, 2012.
en-000000069	In fact, Nebraska did not make its first NCAA Tournament appearance until 1986.
en-000000070	Much of the team's success came under the tenure of Danny Nee, head coach from 1987 to 2000.
en-000000071	Nee is the team's all-time winningest head coach with a record of 254-190.
en-000000072	Barry Collier, who led Nebraska from 2000 to August 2006, left to become athletic director at Butler University.
en-000000073	He previously had been Butler's head coach from 1989 to 2000.
en-000000074	Nebraska hired Doc Sadler from UTEP as men's basketball head coach following the departure of Collier.
en-000000075	Sadler was fired after the first year in the Big Ten and was replaced by Tim Miles from Colorado State.
en-000000076	The same teams played in Grant Hall three weeks later with a similar result, as NU won 23-14.
en-000000077	Such was the modest beginning of a program that has enjoyed its greatest success since 1980.
en-000000078	Nebraska doubled its schedule in 1898, losing twice to the Lincoln YMCA and splitting two games with the Omaha YMCA.
en-000000079	A 16-12 loss against the Omaha YMCA provided evidence as to why Nebraska finished 1-3 that season.
en-000000080	According to The Hesperian account:“The great difficulty of the University team was mere recklessness.
en-000000081	Our boys have been playing with a loose interpretation of the rules.
en-000000082	The next season, Nebraska played an out-of-state opponent for the first time, defeating the University of Kansas, 48-8, at Lincoln.
en-000000083	The 1900 Cornhuskers finished 5-0 and were retroactively ranked second nationally by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.
en-000000084	The Nebraska student yearbook, Sombrero, wrote:“A closely contested game was looked for.
en-000000085	It would be several years before such a claim could be made again.
en-000000086	“Jumbo’'Stiehm, who scored 24 points against Nebraska as a Wisconsin basketball player in 1908, coached both football and basketball.
en-000000087	To be a devoted football or basketball player in the lowest series brings ridicule rather than fame.
en-000000088	His first Husker basketball team won 14 of 15 games, its only loss coming at Minnesota, 40-15.
en-000000089	The student newspaper, The Daily Nebraskan, blamed the loss on Nebraska’s inability to adjust to the Gophers’“100-foot floor.’’
en-000000090	The 1913-14 team was“so fast it took a movie camera to catch‘em,’'according to the Cornhusker student yearbook.
en-000000091	It was described as a“point-aminute’'team, which wasn’t quite accurate.
en-000000092	Typically, games lasted 40 minutes (though that wasn’t always the case), and Nebraska averaged 30 points per game.
en-000000093	Guard Sam Carrier became Nebraska’s first All-America basketball player in 1913.
en-000000094	He and Carl Underwood led the Huskers to 17 victories in 19 games.
en-000000095	Underwood was the Missouri Valley Conference scoring leader with 66 points in 10 conference games.
en-000000096	Nebraska won another conference title outright in 1916, after Sam Waugh replaced Stiehm as the Cornhuskers'coach for one season.
en-000000097	“Doc’'Stewart, whose three Cornhusker teams had a combined record of 29-23.
en-000000098	Nebraska was 22-2 in 1919-20 and 11-3 in 1920-21 under Coach P.J.
en-000000099	After the 1919-20 season, Schissler challenged the University of Chicago to a game, but to no avail.
en-000000100	The Cornhuskers also were invited to a postseason AAU tournament in Atlanta but didn’t go.
en-000000101	Conference rules prohibited such games (Oklahoma had not yet joined the Missouri Valley Conference).
en-000000102	Nebraska returned to the Missouri Valley Conference in 1921, and Owen Frank replaced Schissler as basketball coach.
en-000000103	The remainder of the Roaring 1920s was, for the most part, undistinguished.
en-000000104	There was a center jump after every basket and no requirement to cross mid-court in 10 seconds or less.
en-000000105	The ball was a lot different, too, more like a medicine ball, which contributed to some dull games.
en-000000106	The most significant event during the 1920s was the building of the Coliseum, which was dedicated on Feb. 6, 1926.
en-000000107	The Cornhuskers played two seasons at the Fairgrounds Coliseum, which had a wider court than Grant Hall.
en-000000108	Nebraska defeated conference opponent Grinnell 31-10 before an audience of 1,500, according to newspaper estimates.
en-000000109	Nebraska ended the decade with an 11-5 season under Charles T. Black, a former Kansas All-American in 1928-29.
en-000000110	In the next 19 seasons, the Huskers had just two winning records, back-to-back campaigns under Coach W.H.
en-000000111	The 1937 team tied Kansas for the Big Six championship, after finishing second to the Jayhawks in 1936.
en-000000112	Maclay was the Big Six scoring leader in 1930, scoring 112 points in 10 league games.
en-000000113	Harry Good was hired as head coach in 1946 and after two losing seasons, turned Nebraska’s fortunes around.
en-000000114	The NCAA Tournament was structured differently then, and the Cornhuskers needed to win that playoff to advance into the NCAA field.
en-000000115	They lost to Oklahoma A&M, the Missouri Valley Conference champion, 52-35, at Kansas City, Mo.
en-000000116	Coach Henry Iba's Aggies went on to finish second to Kentucky, coached by Adolph Rupp, in the NCAA Tournament.
en-000000117	In 1949-50, Nebraska again won 16 games and shared the Big Seven crown with Kansas and Kansas State.
en-000000118	That marks the last time the conference had a three-way tie at the top.
en-000000119	“We were King in our day,’'Claude Retherford once told a newspaper reporter.
en-000000120	“They were firing football coaches left and right, but we packed‘em in.
en-000000121	The Cornhuskers had another first-team All-Big Seven performer in 1949, Milton“Bus’'Whitehead.
en-000000122	The 6-10 center from Scottsbluff, Neb., also earned all-conference honors in 1950, when he averaged a then-school-record 15.7 points per game.
en-000000123	Whitehead was named to the District V All-America team by Collier’s Magazine.
en-000000124	Whitehead also was the first Cornhusker selected to play in the East-West All-Star Game in New York City’s Madison Square Garden.
en-000000125	Nebraska basketball experienced another drought beginning in 1950-51, with 15 consecutive losing seasons.
en-000000126	The most dramatic upset during Bush’s tenure as coach came on Feb. 22, 1958, against Kansas.
en-000000127	The Jayhawks featured 7-foot center Wilt Chamberlain and were ranked fourth in the nation when they came to Lincoln.
en-000000128	When the Cornhuskers'captain, Gary Reimers, left the game with leg cramps, Kubacki convinced Bush to let him suit up.
en-000000129	Four minutes and seven seconds later, Kubacki went into the game.
en-000000130	Two minutes and 44 seconds after that, he hit the winning shot.
en-000000131	Following graduation, he was a UW assistant coach until hired at Idaho in March 1960.
en-000000132	His Vandals improved each year and posted a 20-6 record in 1962-63, led by future hall of famer Gus Johnson.
en-000000133	Cipriano’s first two teams struggled and had a combined record of 17-33.
en-000000134	All-Big Eight guard Grant Simmons, the first Cornhusker to earn academic All-Big Eight honors, was the team’s leader.
en-000000135	Guard Marvin Stewart and center Chuck Jura earned All-Big Eight honors for Cipriano in 1971 and 1972, respectively.
en-000000136	With Fort’s leadership, Nebraska began a string of 14 winning seasons.
en-000000137	In the fall of 1976, Cornhusker basketball moved out of the Coliseum and into the state-of the-art Bob Devaney Sports Center.
en-000000138	Located on the State Fairgrounds, the $13 million athletic complex was financed by a special cigarette tax.
en-000000139	For their efforts, the duo shared United Press International Big Eight Coach-of-the-Year honors.
en-000000140	Cipriano brought Nebraska into the modern era, coaching 17 seasons and 450 games.
en-000000141	Following Cipriano’s death in November 1980, Iba was named NU head coach, and he continued Cipriano’s winning ways.
en-000000142	In Iba’s six seasons on the bench, Nebraska was 106-71 and advanced to postseason play four times.
en-000000143	Center Andre Smith was the 1981 Big Eight MVP and twice earned All-Big Eight honors.
en-000000144	The Cornhuskers returned to the NIT each of the next two seasons, advancing to the second round both times.
en-000000145	Hoppen’s college career, though, was ended by a knee injury he sustained in a game at Colorado on Feb. 1, 1986.
en-000000146	After Hoppen’s injury, Iba’s team regrouped and went on to earn the school’s first-ever“official’'NCAA Tournament berth.
en-000000147	Nebraska lost to Western Kentucky in the first round of the Southeast Regional, 67-59.
en-000000148	On March 27, 1986, Danny Nee was officially introduced as Nebraska’s 24th basketball coach.
en-000000149	During a news conference to announce his hiring, Nee said a“new era” in Cornhusker basketball was beginning.
en-000000150	Nee’s 14 teams appeared in postseason play 11 times and topped the 20-victory mark in seven seasons.
en-000000151	In his first season, Nebraska was 21-12 and finished third in the NIT.
en-000000152	The 1990-91 team included two first-round NBA draft picks, senior Rich King and redshirt freshman Eric Piatkowski.
en-000000153	Piatkowski, Nebraska’s sixth-man in 1990-91, went on to win first-team all-conference honors twice.
en-000000154	In 2006, Piatkowski became the third Husker, joining Hoppen and Stu Lantz (No.22), to have his jersey number (52) retired.
en-000000155	In 1992-93, the Huskers registered their highest league finish under Nee by tying for second in the Big Eight.
en-000000156	The Cornhuskers defeated Oklahoma, Missouri and Oklahoma State, in that order, to earn the tournament championship.
en-000000157	The Huskers won two games on the road and scored more than 80 points in four of their five postseason games.
en-000000158	They finished with a 60-56 victory against St. Joseph’s at Madison Square Garden.
en-000000159	The 1996 NIT championship team was one of the most talented in school history.
en-000000160	Two future NBA players, Erick Strickland and 1998 first-round draft pick Tyronn Lue, were in the backcourt.
en-000000161	Lue’s contributions as a freshman to the NIT championship team were only a preview of what was to come.
en-000000162	His leadership carried the 1996-97 Cornhusker team, the first to play in the Big 12, to another NIT appearance.
en-000000163	The bid was the Cornhuskers'fifth during the 1990s and extended the school record postseason run to eight.
en-000000164	The Cornhuskers were off-balance almost from the beginning of the season and fell far short of expectations.
en-000000165	Even though Nee became the winningest coach in school history in 1999-2000, getting victory No.
en-000000166	254 to pass Joe Cipriano in the Cornhuskers'final home game against Colorado, his final team finished with an 11-19 record.
en-000000167	In Collier’s first season with the Huskers, Nebraska finished with a 14-16 mark as Belcher
en-000000168	In Collier's fourth season, Nebraska ran to an 18-13 record and its first postseason bid in five years.
en-000000169	Nebraska struggled the following season but an influx of young talent helped the Huskers move forward.
en-000000170	Maric, the first Australian to ever play basketball for the Huskers, tied the school freshman record for double-doubles.
en-000000171	NU made its second postseason appearance in three years in 2006 before finishing with a 19-14 record.
en-000000172	Sadler's selection as the leader of the men's basketball program had some successes through his first five seasons in Lincoln.
en-000000173	During that time, he has embraced the Husker faithful and provided a breath of excitement across the state.
en-000000174	The success on the court played the biggest part in the ground swell of fan support.
en-000000175	Nebraska finished first in the Big 12 and 18th nationally in scoring defense in 2007-08, allowing just 60.7 points per game.
en-000000176	The defensive strategy Sadler employed earned him 89 victories through five seasons.
en-000000177	The total was the most by a Husker coach in his first five years in Lincoln.
en-000000178	Among the 89 victories were eight against ranked teams, including three ranked teams during the 2010-11 season.
en-000000179	That year, the Huskers reached the NIT, the school's third postseason appearance in the last four seasons.
en-000000180	The 2011-12 season began a new era for Nebraska basketball as the Huskers became members of the Big Ten Conference.
en-000000181	The fall of 2011 also marked the opening of the Hendricks Training Complex.
en-000000182	Hendricks Training Complex, the new home for the Husker Basketball program.
en-000000183	On March 9, 2012, Nebraska Athletic Director Tom Osborne fired Doc Sadler after six seasons at Nebraska.
en-000000184	Sadler chose to address the media and wept as he spoke to reporters.
en-000000185	"I wanted to be the guy that won the first NCAA tournament game.
en-000000186	We can all sit here and talk about this that whatever.
en-000000187	Tim Miles was hired on March 24, 2012, as the head men's basketball coach at Nebraska.
en-000000188	Miles came to Nebraska after a five-year stint at Colorado State University.
en-000000189	Their first game in the new arena was against Florida Gulf Coast on November 8, 2013.
en-000000190	Tim Miles's second season with the Cornhuskers led to the Huskers'first spot in the NCAA men's basketball tournament since 1998.
en-000000191	The Cornhuskers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 17 times.
en-000000192	For nearly four decades, the Holiday Classic has been a showcase of talent and basketball in Bloomington-Normal.
en-000000193	The 2016 tournament will be the 38th anniversary for one of the nation's largest coed high school holiday basketball tournaments.
en-000000194	The Classic was originated in 1975 and was first called the Illinois State Classic.
en-000000195	Normal Community High School was crowned the first boys champion by defeating Chicago Brother Rice, 60-51.
en-000000196	In 1995, the Classic turned down the road that would eventually lead it to the event as it is known today.
en-000000197	A community volunteer group, spearheaded by current tournament president Dan Highland, took over all duties and responsibilities for the tournament.
en-000000198	This group, then known as the Classic Organizing Group, Inc. (COG), consisted of leaders from all aspects of the Bloomington-Normal community.
en-000000199	Rockford Boylan won the first Grand Championship game in 1995, defeating Bloomington Central Catholic 74-63.
en-000000200	The Classic also took on a different twist in 1995 by hosting an 8-team girls'shootout.
en-000000201	This shootout evolved into a 14-team tournament in 1997, and is now a full-fledged 32-team tournament, mirroring the boys tournament format.
en-000000202	The experiment worked so well that the same idea was implemented into the boys'tournament in 2002.
en-000000203	Over the years the Classic has seen its share of great individual performances.
en-000000204	With the Classic becoming more successful, it looked for ways to give back the community and increase its philanthropic efforts.
en-000000205	If this effort is successful, the international community must cooperate fully and swiftly with the Palestinian Authority.
en-000000206	To date, the Classic Foundation has awarded $44,000.00 in scholarships to deserving student-athletes.
en-000000207	Over the years the Holiday Classic has seen its share of great teams and players.

en-000000230	In 2003, fans had a chance to vote on the most outstanding performers in the 25-year history of the tournament.
en-000000231	Each winner received a $1,000 scholarship to go directly to their college of choice to help pay for tuition costs.
en-000000232	Past participants in the Shootout include teams from the following programs:
en-000000233	ICU troops abandoned their barracks in the town of Balad, the last town before the outskirts of Mogadishu.
en-000000234	Ethiopian and Somali government forces, accompanied by patrolling Ethiopian jets, approached within 30 km (18 mi) of the city.
en-000000235	Clan leaders in Mogadishu were considering whether to back the government troops advancing on the capital.
en-000000236	This would preempt a possible lengthy and bloody fight for the capital and deal a devastating blow to the Islamic Courts.
en-000000237	ICU troops were reported in hiding and there was speculation in the capital that Kismayo would fall soon.
en-000000238	Most businesses had closed by the 28th, as proprietors waited for developments.
en-000000239	Pro-government militias were said to have control of key locations, including the former presidential palace.
en-000000240	Governments often forfeit control to smaller groups – militias and the like – operating within and across borders.
en-000000241	On December 29, Ghedi entered the city after consultations with clan leaders on the outskirts.
en-000000242	Roughly 3,000 ICU fighters fled towards the port city of Kismayo, their last remaining stronghold, 300 miles (500km) to the south.
en-000000243	In Kismayo, executive leader of the ICU, Sharif Sheikh Ahmed was defiant,"We will not run away from our enemies.
en-000000244	Also, an explosion occurred around 9pm local time at the Hotel Ramadan in Yaaqshiid district, former headquarters of the ICU.
en-000000245	It was speculated that the target might have been Ethiopian troops who had taken over control of the hotel.
en-000000246	Niccolò Machiavelli started work with the Chancery in Florence at the age of 29, traveling on diplomatic missions around Europe.
en-000000247	He gave Florentine generals successful military advice concerning tactics and organizing infantry forces.
en-000000248	When the Medici come back into power in 1512, Machiavelli was arrested, tortured and exiled from Florence.
en-000000249	It outlined how one could discourage political activism and keep the leader in power.
en-000000250	He encouraged his readers to respect private property and traditions and to use violence prudently.
en-000000251	He did not censor his occasional inhumane methods and was entirely honest in his political advice, earning him a villainous reputation.
en-000000252	In his work he talked about the use of trickery and greed and how the ends justify the means.
en-000000253	Machiavelli recommends, "one must know how to color one's actions and be a great liar and deceiver."
en-000000254	Thus the successful prince must be dishonest and immoral when it suits him.
en-000000255	In the end, they won out over those who tried to act honestly."
en-000000256	Machiavelli does not condone untrustworthy actions but he understands it as the best way to hold on to power.
en-000000257	Machiavelli emphasizes the point that the ends justify the means when the stability and prosperity of the state are in question.
en-000000258	Agathocles had the entire senate of Syracuse killed in order to seize control of the government.
en-000000259	In 2001, a non-state group killed more Americans than the government of Japan killed at Pearl Harbor.
en-000000260	"The Prince" was originally dedicated to Giuliano di Lorenzo de'Medici.
en-000000261	The Prince offended the Medicis and once again Machiavelli had no job.
en-000000262	Taking this in stride, he turned to drama in order to convey his messages.
en-000000263	Machiavelli wrote "Mandragola" after "The Prince" to rehash his political commentary for the upperclass.
en-000000264	Like in "The Prince", Machiavelli argues that uniting opportunistic fortune and skillful strength allows for competence and accord.
en-000000265	In "Mandragola", Machiavelli dramatically portrays these ideas by making the protagonist boast "virtù" and his leading lady encompass "fortuna".
en-000000266	In "Mandragola" there is the classic old husband, youthful wife, competent charlatan and foraging assistant.
en-000000267	But Machiavelli also uses "Commedia Erudita" (learned comedy) to complicate his script by referencing ancient, virtuous, pedagogical texts.
en-000000268	The deception of infidelity in "Mandragola" paired with the play's vague conclusion allow for independent contemplation, which unifies the audience.
en-000000269	The function of trickery appears as a central theme in Machiavelli's "Commedia Erudita", "Mandragola."
en-000000270	The key role that fraud plays in the resolution of the comedy's complications is constantly reaffirmed through the characters'crafty manipulations.
en-000000271	It is apparent that without the use of trickery in "Mandragola", the characters'endeavors would lack success.
en-000000272	Like typical works of " Commedia Erudita", "Mandragola" progresses sequentially through an exposition, complication, and resolution.
en-000000273	In "Mandragola", trickery is employed as a tool for fulfilling the desires of the characters.
en-000000274	The characters also exploit one another's desires in order to achieve their personal goals.
en-000000275	Machiavelli uses stock figures as a way of explaining political themes and satirizing familiar societal elements.
en-000000276	Machiavelli establishes persuasion as the center of almost every scene by embedding rhetoric into the character dialogue.
en-000000277	In each of these examples, the characters use elaborate and insincere language in order to persuade one another.
en-000000278	In "Mandragola", Ligurio is the mastermind behind the manipulation, the root of the play's dramatic deception.
en-000000279	Many scholars have interpreted Ligurio, the ultimate symbol of virtú in "Mandragola", as a‘self-portrait'of Machiavelli.
en-000000280	This comprehension of character is the type of awareness that is necessary for successful acts of manipulation.
en-000000281	One of the many places we experience Ligurio's qualitative insight is in his relationship with Nicia.
en-000000282	Ligurio exploits Nicia's inanity, and uses Nicia's hopes, fears, and insecurities to maneuver Nicia to suit his specific goals.
en-000000283	Drama is usually exemplified by a story's involvement of conflict or contrast of character.
en-000000284	In Machiavelli's "Mandragola", this dramatic disparity is demonstrated through Frate Timoteo.
en-000000285	As an untrustworthy member of the Christian Church, Friar Timoteo takes advantage of his powers in order to exploit innocent women.
en-000000286	He concludes that since he has‘good'intentions, he is therefore free of sin.
en-000000287	Frate Timoteo's character is dramatic because he undermines the expectations that both the audience and the theatrical characters have for him.
en-000000288	One theme up to debate is whether or not "the ends justify the means" for maintaining order.
en-000000289	In "Mandragola", Callimaco, a young Florentine, desires Lucrezia, the wife in a childless marriage to Nicia.
en-000000290	After the conception, Lucrezia is aware of Callimaco's deception, but still accepts him into her private life:
en-000000291	Just as the passion to rule is common in man, it is an allegory to Callimaco's sexual conquest of Lucrezia.
en-000000292	In approaching "Mandragola" through the political analysis, Lucrezia has been viewed as the "Italy" to be conquered.
en-000000293	Being so, she has the same name as the wife of Collatinus, a character of virtue in Machiavelli's Republic Rome.
en-000000294	Callimaco's quest for power through the conquest of Lucrezia is what lends an underlying drama to the comedic theatrical "Mandragola".
en-000000295	The 2008 presidential campaign of Rudy Giuliani began following the formation of the Draft Giuliani movement in October 2005.
en-000000296	At the onset of the campaign, Giuliani had held a significant lead in the nationwide polls by January 2007.
en-000000297	After finishing third in the Florida primary, Giuliani's campaign indicated he would withdraw from the race.
en-000000298	On January 29, 2008, Giuliani exited the race and endorsed the eventual Republican nominee John McCain.
en-000000299	Giuliani's public profile started to rise when he was appointed as the United States Associate Attorney General by President Ronald Reagan.
en-000000300	He held this post until 1989, when resigned to run his first campaign for Mayor of New York City.
en-000000301	He lost the race but won four years later, and served as the city's mayor from 1994 to 2001.
en-000000302	A draft movement began in late 2005 to convince Giuliani to run for President of the United States in 2008.
en-000000303	However, evidence suggested that even among those voters, he enjoyed some support for his possible run.
en-000000304	Some social conservatives contended that Giuliani's emphasis on lowering the abortion rate, was a pragmatic pro-life view.
en-000000305	Among the overall public, Giuliani was perceived to be a moderate.
en-000000306	Throughout 2006, rumors circulated regarding a possible Giuliani presidential campaign, abetted by hints from the former mayor himself.
en-000000307	He confirmed his candidacy on the February 14 edition of "Larry King Live", firmly stating: "Yes, I'm running."
en-000000308	According to a Gallup Poll taken February 9–11 2007, responders who supported Giuliani were asked why they supported him.
en-000000309	He cited the economic platform and leadership of the candidate in his reasoning for support.
en-000000310	It is time the rest of the country benefit from a true fiscal conservative leader who gets real results."
en-000000311	China’s leaders recognize that their country needs time, space, and peace for economic development.
en-000000312	Forbes was named National Campaign Co-Chair and Senior Advisor for the campaign following his endorsement.
en-000000313	In the non-scientific six-part MSNBC online vote following the debate, Giuliani finished in 3rd place (15%).
en-000000314	A May 10, 2007 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll put Giuliani ahead of Hillary Clinton, 48% to 42% in Connecticut.
en-000000315	Right now, we're building an embassy in Iraq that is bigger than the Vatican.
en-000000316	What would we say here if China was doing this in our country or in the Gulf of Mexico?
en-000000317	They've already now since that time have killed 3,400 of our men, and I don't think it was necessary.
en-000000318	I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th.
en-000000319	And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that.
en-000000320	PAUL: I believe very sincerely that the CIA is correct when they teach and talk about blowback.
en-000000321	When we went into Iran in 1953 and installed the Shah, yes there was blowback.
en-000000322	The reaction to that was the taking of our hostages, and that persists.
en-000000323	And if we ignore that, we ignore that at our own risk.
en-000000324	If we think we can do what we want around the world and not incite hatred, then we have a problem.
en-000000325	I mean what would we think if other foreign countries were doing that to us?
en-000000326	News Corporation, the parent company of Fox News, is a client of the Bracewell& Giuliani law firm.
en-000000327	Dobson wrote,"I cannot, and will not, vote for Rudy Giuliani in 2008.
en-000000328	Among that money he raised the second-most from Wall Street of all presidential candidates, with $1.8 million raised.
en-000000329	Giuliani started June at the third GOP debate in Manchester, New Hampshire.
en-000000330	Look, for someone who went to parochial schools all his life, this is a very frightening thing that's happening right now.
en-000000331	But the reality is, I respect, you know, the opinion of Catholic— (off mike)— religious leaders of all kinds.
en-000000332	Religion is very important to me, it's a very important part of my life.
en-000000333	Two days later, he released an expanded version of the twelve commitments, with more detailed goals for each one.
en-000000334	In June 2007, Giuliani drew some criticism for dropping out of the August Iowa Straw Poll.
en-000000335	Some Republican officials felt the move could be seen as "dissing Iowa."
en-000000336	In response, a man in a chicken suit, known as the Iowa Chicken, began demonstrating at Giuliani's appearances in Iowa.
en-000000337	Despite this, Giuliani maintained that he was still planning on competing in the Iowa Caucus.
en-000000338	Some political observers have opined that the Straw Poll results are bought by campaigns.
en-000000339	Giuliani had emerged as the frontrunner after overtaking John McCain in the polls.
en-000000340	With the exposure and eventual entrance of Fred Thompson into the field, Giuliani's poll numbers began to drop.
en-000000341	According to the CBS News Poll taken June 26–28, Giuliani held the lead over Thompson 34% to 21%.
en-000000342	Indeed, Sam Brownback, a lower-tier candidate had more staff in Iowa than Giuliani did.
en-000000343	Some political analysts called it a risky strategy that had never been attempted before by a Republican presidential candidate.
en-000000344	Mitt Romney led with 31.6 percent; Thompson received 1.4 percent; Giuliani received 1.3 percent.
en-000000345	Giuliani unveiled his health care plan on July 31, 2007, which proposed a tax deduction ("not" a tax credit)
en-000000346	of up to $15,000 for families and up to $7,500 for individuals who purchase private individual health insurance policies.
en-000000347	Giuliani wrote about his plan on August 3, 2007, in an article to the "Boston Globe".
en-000000348	In it he stated that taxes should not be raised to provide more health care but instead lowered for "individual empowerment".
en-000000349	In August, Giuliani claimed that he "was at Ground Zero as often, if not more, than most workers."
en-000000350	This contrasted with recovery workers at the site who spent this much time at the site in two to three days.
en-000000351	However, Giuliani scaled back in his claims recognizing that he didn't mean to say it exactly as it came out,
en-000000352	He believes this is a personal matter and that there shouldn't be a religious test for public office.
en-000000353	He replied,"I love my family very, very much and will do anything for them...
en-000000354	The best thing I can say is kind of,'Leave my family alone, just like I'll leave your family alone.'"
en-000000355	Also representing the Giuliani camp as consultants are, Chris Mottola and Associates, BrabenderCox and Crossroads Media.
en-000000356	Giuliani wrote an essay speaking about the need for changes in the State Department and a "revolution in diplomatic affairs".
en-000000357	Giuliani stresses that diplomacy should be an important facet of foreign policy but cannot be overused.
en-000000358	The Giuliani campaign paid for an ad in the "New York Times" published September 14, 2007.
en-000000359	Highlighted was the statement made by Clinton about "the willing suspension of disbelief".
en-000000360	The ad was completed with a statement by Giuliani saying, "These times call for statesmanship, not politicians spewing political venom."
en-000000361	Shortly thereafter a vast array of Internet blogs criticized the call as being a phony political gimmick.
en-000000362	While Jeff Barker, a campaign spokesman confirmed, "the call was not planned."
en-000000363	Democratic presidential candidate Chris Dodd called the theme "unconscionable, shameless and sickening."
en-000000364	The CNP's official statement read, "If the Republican Party nominates a pro-abortion candidate, we will consider running a third-party candidate."
en-000000365	In October 2007, Former Wisconsin Governor, Secretary of Health and Human Services and 2008 presidential candidate Tommy Thompson endorsed Giuliani.
en-000000366	Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that"Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader.
en-000000367	He is America's mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership."
en-000000368	Giuliani's coverage amount trailed that of Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, however.
en-000000369	This ratio was very close to Clinton's, better than McCain's, and worse than Obama's.
en-000000370	In the third quarter, Giuliani raised $11 million, first among Republicans.
en-000000371	As of October, 2007, he had raised $44 million and had $16 million cash on hand.
en-000000372	Giuliani said that"I made a mistake of not clearing him effectively enough.
en-000000373	I take the responsibility for that", and defended Kerik's performance in the city positions he had held.
en-000000374	Giuliani also declined to say whether he might one day issue a presidential pardon for Kerik.
en-000000375	By late November 2007, there were consistent attacks, sometimes personal, between Giuliani and fellow Republican contender Mitt Romney.
en-000000376	Romney responded that Giuliani was "throwing stones from a glass house" in light of the Kerik indictment.
en-000000377	The two also sparred over the immigration issue during a November 28 debate.
en-000000378	Giuliani denied that he or his administration had done anything improper, and called the charges a "political hit job".
en-000000379	Combined with the Kerik developments, they associated an air of political-personal doubt around the candidate.
en-000000380	"The Wall Street Journal " stated that"These are perilous times for Rudy Giuliani."
en-000000381	It's because I've been tested...and I got very, very remarkable results.
en-000000382	He also began airing his first television advertisement in key caucus-primary states.
en-000000383	The ad concentrated solely on the transformation of New York City under the Giuliani mayoralty.
en-000000384	Observers likened the ad to Republican icon Ronald Reagan's famous "Morning in America" ad.
en-000000385	Giuliani led among primary voters in Florida receiving 38%, ahead of his closest rival, Mitt Romney by 21%.
en-000000386	However, in head to head matchups, Giuliani was losing his lead.
en-000000387	A November 9–11th poll had Clinton and Giuliani tied at 45% in the traditional red state of Virginia.
en-000000388	Most dangerously, his lead in Florida, the first state that he planned to heavily contest, was dwindling as well.
en-000000389	He had been second in polls in the state as late as early October.
en-000000390	Giuliani continued to maintain that his strategy of focusing on later, larger primaries would result in his winning the nomination.
en-000000391	Before the New Hampshire votes had been counted, Giuliani's campaign moved to Florida in preparation for the state's January 29 primary.
en-000000392	"I want you to come join us there and help us", he said.
en-000000393	By January 2008, Giuliani's popularity had slipped significantly, both in the polls and media attention.
en-000000394	Crist had planned to endorse Giuliani in the early autumn, and had still been expected to do so in early January.
en-000000395	Whereas previously Giuliani had declared that he would campaign on regardless of the Florida results, he now was more vague.
en-000000396	One New Jersey poll had him losing a 32-point lead since October and trailing McCain there.
en-000000397	A Zogby poll showed a close race in New York, but also put McCain ahead.
en-000000398	Thus, following his Florida defeat, there was no reason to continue on.
en-000000399	The endorsement was done with enthusiasm, as Giuliani and McCain were genuine friends as well as allied on many political issues.
en-000000400	Giuliani's defeat continued a long tradition of Mayors of New York not succeeding at attempts for higher office.
en-000000401	Giuliani's campaign faced challenges due to repeated scandals involving political associates and campaign staff.
en-000000402	Giuliani's state chairman in South Carolina, state treasurer Thomas Ravenel, was indicted on June 19, 2007, on cocaine distribution charges.
en-000000403	Giuliani released a statement saying that Ravenel had stepped down from his position in the Giuliani campaign.
en-000000404	Ravenel's father, former congressman Arthur Ravenel, Jr., replaced his son as state co-chair.
en-000000405	The elder Ravenel had previously seen his own share of controversy due to racially inflammatory remarks.
en-000000406	Senator and Giuliani Southern Region campaign chair David Vitter (R- Louisiana) had been associated with an alleged Washington prostitution service.
en-000000407	Subsequently, a former brothel operator from New Orleans also asserted Senator Vitter had been one her clients.
en-000000408	Giuliani stated that the allegations were "a personal matter" for Vitter.
en-000000409	Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign was endorsed by some notable individuals including businessmen, politicians, athletes, and actors.
en-000000410	In addition to this considerable debt, Giuliani's "high appearance fees dropped like a stone" following his failure to win the nomination.
en-000000411	Under this ideology, it is assumed that there was a greater Chinese state in the ancient past.
en-000000412	Similar projects have been conducted on Tibet and Xinjiang, which have been named Southwest Project and Northwest Project, respectively.
en-000000413	Due to its claims on Gojoseon, Goguryeo and Balhae, the project sparked disputes with Korea.
en-000000414	However, there has been a shift from anti-American and pro-China to a pro-American and anti-China in Korea as a strategic move.
en-000000415	Research in the Northeast Project has claimed Gojoseon, Bueyo, Goguryeo and Balhae as regional governments of the ancient Chinese empire.
en-000000416	The Northeast Project has also received strong criticism from academic experts from South Korea and many other countries including China.
en-000000417	Controversy mainly focused on Goguryeo, which plays a central role in Korean nationalism.
en-000000418	Government plays a central role in financing the services that people want, like education and health care.
en-000000419	However, there are doubts to whether the Northeast Project is truly finished, according to some Korean scholars that is still debatable.
en-000000420	In 2004 the Australian government has identified transnational terrorism as also a threat to Australia and to Australian citizens overseas.
en-000000421	The events leading to the Eureka Rebellion were arguably Australia's first acts of terror.
en-000000422	Two muslim men shot dead four people and wounded seven more, before being killed by police and military officers.
en-000000423	Neither of the men were members of any official armed force.
en-000000424	In today's parlance, their attack would be described as an act of Lone wolf (terrorism).
en-000000425	The perpetrators of the attack were believed to be Croatian separatists.
en-000000426	Two garbage collectors and a police officer were killed and eleven others were injured.
en-000000427	As a result of the bombing, ASIO's powers and budget were greatly expanded.
en-000000428	It was also a motivation for the formation of the Australian Federal Police.
en-000000429	The Justice Commandos for the Armenian Genocide claimed responsibility but the culprits were never identified and no charges were laid.
en-000000430	Van Tongeren was eventually imprisoned for a long period of time until his release in the early-mid 2000s.
en-000000431	The bombing of the Israeli Consulate and Hakoah Club in Sydney occurred on 23 December 1982.
en-000000432	The two bombings occurred on the same day within five hours of each other.
en-000000433	The initial case led to a single arrest though charges were later dropped.
en-000000434	In 2011, the NSW police and Australian federal police reopened the case citing new leads.
en-000000435	Levon Demirian, a Sydney resident with links to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, was charged over the attack and served 10 years.
en-000000436	He shot and killed a security guard at the clinic before his capture and arrest.

en-000000670	below the level at which business policy and rules are implemented).
en-000000671	Although these policies must be implemented at a local level, they should be catalyzed and supported by European institutions.
en-000000672	"Loosely coupled" means that each application is relatively independent of the other applications in the overall system.
en-000000673	Therefore, in a loosely coupled environment, one application can be altered without the alteration necessarily affecting others.
en-000000674	That extreme is considered an unlikely nirvana at the present time.
en-000000675	Integrating OSSs means that data must be shared between the applications.
en-000000676	But imagine the difficulty that would occur if the ordering application worked on products that consists of bundles of sub-products (e.g.
en-000000677	Trying to convert hierarchical products into non-hierarchical ones without losing information would not be possible.
en-000000678	A single information model for data that is shared between applications in this way provides a solution to this problem.
en-000000679	The TMF solution to this is called the Shared Information/Data-Model (SID).
en-000000680	However, for large operators with many hundreds of separate OSSs, the proliferation of interfaces became a serious problem.
en-000000681	In this model, OSSs interface with the CCI rather than directly with each other.
en-000000682	The CCI thus allows applications to work together using the CCI to link them together.
en-000000683	In this way, each application only requires one interface (to the CCI) rather than many (to other applications).
en-000000684	The complexity is therefore reduced to one of order n, rather than n.
en-000000685	The CCI may also provide other services, including security, data translation, etc.
en-000000686	but also the functionality of the application, the data used, the pre- and post-conditions, etc.
en-000000687	The Frameworx contract specification provides a means to document these interfaces, and these are therefore contract defined interfaces.
en-000000688	Frameworx contracts can be seen as extensions of Application Programming Interface (API) specifications.
en-000000689	The eTOM (enhanced Telecom Operations Map, pronounced ee-tom) is the Frameworx business process framework.
en-000000690	The model is based on considerable earlier work, including Zachman Framework, Kernighan, Yourdon, and the Object Management Group's Model Driven Architecture.
en-000000691	The Frameworx lifecycle divides systems development into 4 stages: requirements, system design, implementation and operation.
en-000000692	As stated earlier, the Frameworx Contract is the fundamental unit of interoperability in an Frameworx system.
en-000000693	Interoperability is important for each of the four views defined by the Frameworx Lifecycle.
en-000000694	The Telecom Application Map (TAM) links process views and data/information views to describe IT-type applications that service providers can procure.

en-000000733	Harmar Denny was born in Pittsburgh the son of Ebenezer Denny and Nancy Wilkins.
en-000000734	His father had served as adjutant to General Harmar during wars on the western frontier.
en-000000735	One way or the other, the war on Western values is a war that China can only lose.
en-000000736	He married Elizabeth F. O'Hara on November 25, 1817 and they had 11 children.
en-000000737	Elizabeth was the daughter of General James O'Hara and Mary Carson O'Hara.
en-000000738	He served as a member of the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives from 1824 to 1829.
en-000000739	In 1829 he became a ruling elder of the First Presbyterian Church of Pittsburgh.
en-000000740	He was reelected to the Twenty-second through Twenty-fourth Congresses and served from December 15, 1829, to March 3, 1837.
en-000000741	He was a presidential elector on the Whig ticket in 1840.
en-000000742	In 1849 he was elected president of the common council of Pittsburgh.
en-000000743	He declined the nomination to be a candidate for Congress in 1850.
en-000000744	He served as president of the Pittsburgh& Steubenville Railroad Company in 1851 and 1852.
en-000000745	New York State Senator Henry E. H. Brereton (1865–1957) was his grandson; Congressman Harmar D. Denny, Jr. (1886–1966) was his great-grandson.
en-000000746	Wohlen is a municipality in the district of Bremgarten in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.
en-000000747	The earliest known settlements in Wohlen date from the late Hallstatt era (600-500 BC).
en-000000748	This settlement left two clusters of burial mounds in "Hohbühl" and "Häslerhau".
en-000000749	While the graves were discovered and excavated in 1925-1930, the location of the settlement is still unknown.
en-000000750	During the Roman era two large estates were built at Oberdorf and the Brünishalde.
en-000000751	Both estates date from about 50 AD and supported a number of fields.
en-000000752	The harvested grain was probably for the maintenance of the Roman troops at the military camp Vindonissa.
en-000000753	Of the estates all that remains is masonry, tile, mosaic pieces and coins, as well as some foundations at "Häslerhau".
en-000000754	With the migration of the Germanic tribe, the place name became Wohlen.
en-000000755	So, the Alemannic name of "Vuolon/ Volen" referred to the earlier inhabitants.
en-000000756	One of the reasons for the slow integration of the two populations was the lack of an ecclesiastical center.
en-000000757	Wohlen had no parish church, but was split between three parishs, Niederwil, Göslikon and Villmergen.
en-000000758	Shortly after 1100, an ancestor of the Lords of Volen donated a small church to the village.
en-000000759	This church served until 1518 but didn't include the whole population.
en-000000760	The number of households climbed from 48 to 60 (1540–1570), i.e., about 240 to 300 people.
en-000000761	Starting in 1635, there are church records, so the population is known.
en-000000762	The population increased slowly until about 1800, as the local economy could not support rapid growth.
en-000000763	China’s economy is prone to rapid growth, with buoyant investment demand sustaining powerful short-term inflationary pressures.
en-000000764	However, in 1800 Wohlen had a larger population than either Bremgarten or Villmergen (1397 inhabitants against Bremgarten 599; Villmergen 888).
en-000000765	In 1830, it was the site of a meeting to attempt to reform the cantonal constitution.
en-000000766	Two days later, the milita assembled near Wohlen and marched on Aarau.
en-000000767	Following a bloodless invasion of Aarau, known as the Freiämtersturm, the government agreed to every demand of the rebels.
en-000000768	Of this area, 39.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while 27.9% is forested.
en-000000769	Of the rest of the land, 32.1% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (0.6%) is non-productive (rivers or lakes).
en-000000770	The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is "Argent a Pile inverted Sable and a Chief Gules."
en-000000771	Over the last 10 years (1997–2007) the population has changed at a rate of 9.4%.
en-000000772	Of the adult population, 1,870 people or 13.2% of the population are between 20 and 29 years old.
en-000000773	In the 2007 federal election the most popular party was the SVP which received 37.9% of the vote.
en-000000774	The next three most popular parties were the SP (16.9%), the CVP (16.8%) and the FDP (12.4%).
en-000000775	At the burial mounds, graves of men, women and children were found.

en-000000782	The following criteria were taken into consideration when assessing the final project proposals:
en-000000783	Degree to which the project addresses the Millennium Development Goals, especially poverty eradication and sustainable social development
en-000000784	Relevance of project proposal in mitigating negative impacts of climate change
en-000000785	And the impact of climate change is increasingly, though still inadequately, being factored into national and local budgets.
en-000000786	Feasibility of the proposed project– demonstration of the practicality of implementing the proposed project, and benefit to local community;
en-000000787	Quality of Dialogue– level of communication within project teams and student groups, balanced involvement of both student groups
en-000000788	Students from all fields of engineering were eligible to register for the Mondialogo Engineering Award.
en-000000789	Employees of commercial institutions and companies or students above 35 years of age were not eligible to participate.

en-000000955	The female possesses majestic, beauty and gracious talent, however take heed not to underestimate these beings.
en-000000956	Deriving from the planet Earth, the female gender seeks an imperial state of existence.
en-000000957	They retain great knowledge in Crafting skills and Magical Arts due to an extensive training.
en-000000958	Unpredictable in their ventures, these individuals are acutely intelligent and incredibly swift.
en-000000959	Heroic in a sense, females are versatile and steady in all traditions.
en-000000960	The average height is 5.5 feet and weight of 125 pounds.
en-000000961	This generation of humanity is robust and well educated, originating from the planet earth.
en-000000962	The males you find in this realm are of high caliber, physically and mentally.
en-000000963	Geared for war, they are elite and accelerate in the development of Engineering skills, which can be used in Melee Arts.
en-000000964	Conquering kingdoms of war, victory lies within these natural born leaders.

en-000000968	They reign with immoral vitality and utmost greed in their home world, Malia.
en-000000969	The sheer mention of the Bloblics sends fear through all those who are against this species.
en-000000970	They are astute in developing weapons of mass destruction and gain skill quite rapidly.
en-000000971	Far from harboring weapons of mass destruction, he was focused on maintaining his grip on power.
en-000000972	Weapons of mass destruction could not be found, and the connection with al Qaeda could not be established.
en-000000973	Both Iran and the US consider the use of weapons of mass destruction a grave crime.
en-000000974	So a threat – Iraqi weapons of mass destruction – had to be created.
en-000000975	These marauders are focused combatants that fight at frantic paces and are not very graceful to observe.

en-000000980	Dam removal is the process of demolishing a dam, leaving a river to flow freely.
en-000000981	It is undertaken for a variety of reasons that include environmental rehabilitation, structural weakness and maintenance expense.
en-000000982	When the negative environmental effects outweigh the benefits, a dam may be considered for removal.
en-000000983	Dam failure is another threat that can lead to the removal of dams.
en-000000984	Sometimes the fear of failure is due to seismic activity or the placement of the dam.
en-000000985	Additionally, the older the dam is, the more likely it is to fail.
en-000000986	[1] By 2020, in the United States alone, 85% percent of the country’s dams will have exceeded that 50 year threshold.
en-000000987	Finally, economic reasons often provide a convincing reason to remove a dam.
en-000000988	Today’s particular economic circumstances provide a second reason for establishing a National Investment Bank.
en-000000989	Additionally, population centers and industrial facilities that demanded hydropower decades ago can move and leave the dam without a purpose.
en-000000990	In the United States roughly 900 dams were removed between 1990 and 2015, with another 50 to 60 more every year.
en-000000991	Because of the age of these dams, over time the risk for catastrophic failure increases.
en-000000992	Among the largest of these water diversion projects is the Columbia Basin Project, which diverts water at the Grand Coulee Dam.
en-000000993	The Bureau of Reclamation manages many of these water diversion projects.
en-000000994	Some dams in the Pacific Northwest and California block passage for anadromous fish species such as Pacific Salmon and steelhead.
en-000000995	In the Desert Southwest, dams can change the nature of the river ecosystem.
en-000000996	There are severals ways dams can be removed and the chosen method will depend on many factors.
en-000000997	Removal is costly no matter what and expenses typically rise when greater weight is given to environmental concerns.
en-000000998	Four of the most common dam removal methods are described below.
en-000000999	Other times, the sediment can increase the turbidity of the river harming fish, scour the landscape, and bury infrastructure.
en-000001000	Sediment can be tested before it is released to determine if it will be harmful to the landscape below the dam.
en-000001001	Dam removal can have adverse consequences if this is not done.
en-000001002	The notch and release approach is commonly used because of its ecological benefits.
en-000001003	It is a slow method in which the reservoir is drained through notches cut into the dam.
en-000001004	New notches are cut in so the water drains out of the reservoir at a consistent flow.
en-000001005	The sediment trapped behind the dam flows downstream in a fixed rate that allows the ecosystem to adjust to the changes.
en-000001006	This method can takes months or even over a year, but has proven success with restoring fish species to rivers.
en-000001007	The Elwha and Glines Canyon dam removal project used the notch and release approach to great success.
en-000001008	The rapid release approach is both the quickest and least expensive way to remove a dam, but comes with significant drawbacks.
en-000001009	In this approach, a large tunnel is dug through the base of the dam and then connected to the reservoir.
en-000001010	The dig and dewater approach is typically the most expensive dam removal method, but is necessary in some cases.
en-000001011	It entails emptying the entire reservoir, allowing the sediment to dry, and then transporting it to a safe location for disposal.
en-000001012	Another situation is if the sediments behind the dam contain toxins.
en-000001013	Hauling them away and disposing of them safely is important for the ecological health of the river.
en-000001014	The retained sediment approach is the final commonly used approach and involves leaving the sediment behind where it is.
en-000001015	To do this, the river or creek must be rerouted around the damsite which can prove expensive and challenging.
en-000001016	These goals include maximizing the efficiency of existing dams and minimizing their environmental impact.
en-000001017	Updating equipment and acknowledging that dams have a limited life span are two ways to achieve those goals.
en-000001018	One part of river restoration that does not have to wait until the dam is removed is introducing environmental flow.
en-000001019	Three million new cubic yards of sediment are deposited behind the lower four dams on the Snake River annually.
en-000001020	The levees in Lewiston were designed to leave five feet between water levels and the top of the levees.
en-000001021	Malibu Creek once supported the southernmost steelhead population in the world.
en-000001022	After being notched twice and largely silted up, 90% of its design capacity has been lost.
en-000001023	As of 2013 stakeholders agree that the dam and its sediment be removed, but no funding source has been identified.
en-000001024	The reservoir also loses more than 6 percent of the total annual flow of the Colorado River to evaporation and seepage.
en-000001025	If it were to be removed, it would dwarf any completed dam removal project in history.
en-000001026	The Kinni is a cold water fishery supporting a population of native Brook Trout and naturally reproducing Brown Trout.
en-000001027	This designation indicates that the State of Wisconsin has determined the Kinnickinnic River warrants additional protection from the effects of pollution.

en-000001068	The YouTube Music Awards is a music award show presented by YouTube.
en-000001069	Farm water, also known as agricultural water, is water committed for use in the production of food and fiber.
en-000001070	Farm water may include water used in the irrigation of crops or the watering of livestock.
en-000001071	It has been shown, that in areas without healthy water resources or sanitation services that economic growth cannot be sustained.
en-000001072	Without access to clean water, nearly every industry would suffer, most notably, would be agriculture.
en-000001073	As water scarcity grows as a global concern, food security is also brought into consideration.
en-000001074	Nuclear security is a matter of global concern, and global action is required.
en-000001075	Livestock and meat production have one of the largest water footprints of the agricultural industry.
en-000001076	Taking nearly 1,800 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef and 576 gallons for pork.
en-000001077	For reference, it only takes about 108 gallons of water to harvest one pound of corn.
en-000001078	Livestock production is also one of the most resource intensive agricultural outputs.
en-000001079	Livestock's large water consumption may also be attributed to the amount of time it takes to raise an animal to slaughter.
en-000001080	Again, in contrast to corn, which grows to maturity in about 100 days.
en-000001081	This adds an extra 995 days of water to grow cattle.
en-000001082	To date, beef is the most popular of the meats; the U.S. alone produced 25.8 billion pounds in 2013.
en-000001083	In this same year, 201.2 billion pounds of milk were produced.
en-000001084	These cattle are mostly raised in centralized animal feeding operations, or CAFOs.
en-000001085	The amount of water that cattle may drink in a day also depends upon the temperature.
en-000001086	Cattle have a feed conversion ratio of 6:1, for every six pounds of food consumed, the animal should gain one pound.
en-000001087	Thus, there is also a substantial "indirect" need for water in order to grow the feed for the livestock.
en-000001088	Growing the amount of feed grains necessary for raising livestock accounts for 56 percent of the U.S water consumption.
en-000001089	Of a 1,000 pound cow, only 430 pounds make it to the retail markets.
en-000001090	This shift has led to more efficient feeding and health methods, allowing ranchers to harvest more beef per animal.
en-000001091	The rising popularity of these CAFOs are creating a larger demand for water, however.
en-000001092	Additionally, farmers monitor flock water consumption to measure the overall health of their birds.
en-000001093	As birds grow older they should be consuming more feed and about three times as much water.
en-000001094	In just three weeks a bird's water consumption should increase by about 10 gallons a day.
en-000001095	When it is hot outside bird will pant to keep cool, thus losing much of their water.
en-000001096	A study based in Ohio showed that 67 percent of water sampled near poultry farms contained antibiotics.
en-000001097	With modern advancements, crops are being cultivated year round in countries all around the world.
en-000001098	As water usage becomes a more pervasive global issue, irrigation practices for crops are being refined and becoming more sustainable.
en-000001099	While there are a variety of irrigation systems, these may be grouped into two types: high flow and low flow.
en-000001100	These systems must be managed precisely to prevent runoff, over spray, or low-head drainage.
en-000001101	Successful agriculture is dependent upon farmers having sufficient access to water.
en-000001102	However, water scarcity is already a critical constraint to farming in many parts of the world.
en-000001103	It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed.
en-000001104	This can happen where there is over development of hydraulic infrastructure, usually for irrigation.
en-000001105	Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater.
en-000001106	Many of the practices which cut water use are cost effective.
en-000001107	Farmers who use straw, compost, or mulch around their crops will reduce evaporation by about 75 percent.
en-000001108	This would also reduce the number of weeds and save a farmer from using herbicides.
en-000001109	Mulches or ground covers also allow the soils to absorb more water by reducing compaction.
en-000001110	In addition to reducing water loss at the sink, there are also more sustainable ways to harvest water.
en-000001111	Many modern small (non industrial) farmers are using rain barrels to collect the water needed for their crops and livestock.
en-000001112	On average, rainwater harvesting reduces the cost of water per cubic meter in half.
en-000001113	This would also greatly reduce the stress on local aquifers and wells.
en-000001114	“I... try to remember the smell of the bus that used to meet one at the station in 1908.
en-000001115	The impression of waste and extravagance which assailed one the moment one entered the doors of the house.
en-000001116	The story is mainly set in the House of Chevron, an enormous country estate in the south of England.
en-000001117	In some passages the setting switches to London, for example when Sebastian visits Teresa.
en-000001118	The plot covers the years of Sebastian's and Viola's adolescence which means approximately 1905–1910.
en-000001119	Sebastian, is the 19-year-old heir to the country estate of Chevron.
en-000001120	Yet coming from a middle-class background she is extremely impressed by and interested in aristocratic society.
en-000001121	The world’s quintessential middle-class society is on the way to becoming its first former middle-class society.
en-000001122	Leonard Anquetil compares Chevron to a“splendid tomb” and states, that“the house is dying from the top”, which indicates change.
en-000001123	Sackville-West also describes the different social expectations to the different genders concerning their sexuality.

en-000001567	China said "We respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
en-000001568	A spokesman restated China's belief of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations and urged dialogue.
en-000001569	However, India subsequently made it clear that it will not support any "unilateral measures" against Russian government.
en-000001570	Therefore, we will also not support any unilateral measures by a country or a group of countries against Russia."
en-000001571	Sri Lanka described Yanukovych's removal as unconstitutional and considered Russia's concerns in Crimea as justified.
en-000001572	After Russia moved to formally incorporate Crimea, some worried whether it may do the same in other regions.
en-000001573	Russian officials stated that Russian troops would not enter other areas.
en-000001574	On 9 April, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe deprived Russia of voting rights.
en-000001575	On 14 August, while visiting Crimea, Vladimir Putin ruled out pushing beyond Crimea.
en-000001576	Though a total of 13 council members voted in favour of the resolution and China abstained, Russia vetoed the resolution.
en-000001577	It affirmed the council's commitment to the "sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders."
en-000001578	The resolution got 100 votes in its favour, while 11 nations voted against and 58 countries abstained from the vote.
en-000001579	The vast majority of the international community has not recognised the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol as part of Russia.
en-000001580	Afghanistan, Cuba, Kyrgyzstan, and Nicaragua have recognised the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol as federal subjects.
en-000001581	No matter whether you recognize it or not, the fact remains."
en-000001582	Three non-UN member states recognised the results of the referendum: Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Nagorno-Karabakh.
en-000001583	On 16 April 2014 Transnistria urged Russia and the United Nations to recognise its independence.
en-000001584	Putin is aware of Transnistria's recognition request, according to Dmitry Peskov.
en-000001585	The regional council of Italy's northern region Lombardy has adopted a non-binding resolution on recognizing Crimea as part of Russia.
en-000001586	Sanctions were imposed to prevent Russian and Crimean officials and politicians travelling to Canada, the United States, and the European Union.
en-000001587	They were the most wide-ranging used on Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.
en-000001588	These include suspension of talks relating to military, space, investment, and visa requirements.
en-000001589	Russian companies started pulling billions of dollars out of Western banks to avoid any asset freeze.
en-000001590	Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird, said the sanctions were "a badge of honour."
en-000001591	Expanded Western sanctions in mid-March coursed through financial markets, hitting the business interests of some Russia's richest people.
en-000001592	Financial markets will have to be broadened, so that people and businesses can better hedge their risks.
en-000001593	The Americans centred on the heart of Moscow's leadership, though the EU's initial list shied from targeting Putin's inner circle.
en-000001594	A number of Russian citizens reported that they have been denied European visas after they visited Crimea after annexation.
en-000001595	Subsequently, after Russian authority became established, wages were cut back again by 30% to 70%.
en-000001596	Tourism, previously Crimea's main industry, suffered in particular; it was down by 50% from 2014.
en-000001597	The Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park is a technology park in the Pudong district of Shanghai, China.
en-000001598	The park specializes in research in life sciences, software, semiconductors, and information technology.
en-000001599	As of 2009, there were 110 research and development institutions, 3,600 companies and 100,000 workers located in the technology park.
en-000001600	In some circles the park is also known as China's Silicon Valley.
en-000001601	In August 1999, the Shanghai Municipal Committee and Municipal Government developed a strategy and accompanying report called "Focus on Zhangjiang."
en-000001602	The report identified that investments from the IC industry, the software industry, and the biomedical industry would be targeted.
en-000001603	Belarus already has a budding software industry that reports net annual revenues of $300 million.
en-000001604	Software firms include IBM, Citibank, eBay, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and SAP AG.
en-000001605	Chemical companies include Wison Group, DSM, Henkel, Dow, Dupont, and Rohm and Haas.
en-000001606	Semiconductor firms include Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), Hua Hong NEC, Grace Semiconductor, Spreadtrum, and VeriSilicon.
en-000001607	Other firms present include Asia-Pacific Software, Sony, Bearing Point, Kyocera, Cognizant, TCS China, Satyam and Applied Materials.
en-000001608	There are also a multitude of biotech firms, over a hundred of them being domestically owned companies.
en-000001609	Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park can be reached via the inner or outer ring roads that serve the Shanghai metropolitan area.
en-000001610	The park is 3.6 km from Nanpu Bridge and 13 km from People's Square.
en-000001611	Longdong Avenue on the park's northern boundary is the main road connecting the inner ring road and Shanghai Pudong International Airport.
en-000001612	Luonan Avenue on the park's western boundary is the feeder road connecting the inner ring road and outer ring road.
en-000001613	It is 21 km from Pudong Airport and 25 km from Hongqiao Airport.
en-000001614	The Zhangjiang Tram system, which runs inside the zone and connects to the metro line is also available.
en-000001615	When the Spanish arrived, the Totonac ethnicity dominated this large region, although they themselves were dominated by the Aztec Empire.
en-000001616	Today, the term refers only to a region in the north of Veracruz were Totonac culture is still important.
en-000001617	The area thrived with many small villages and ceremonial center because of abundant agricultural production.
en-000001618	It was populated by other cultures before this, which have since been lost.
en-000001619	Their main archeological sites include El Tajín, Cempoala and Yohualichan (in the Sierra Norte de Puebla).
en-000001620	However, these western areas had become ethnically mixed due to influxes of Nahuas and Otomis long before the Spanish arrived.
en-000001621	Because of this, the Totonacs allied with the Spanish against the Aztecs to conquer Tenochtitlán.
en-000001622	However, war, disease and forced labor brought the Totonac population down drastically.
en-000001623	The Spanish also took their lands for cattle raising until the ethnicity occupied only about half of what it used to.
en-000001624	In many areas, the Totonac population was replaced by Spanish, mestizo and African peoples.
en-000001625	Until the 17th century, the Spanish mostly respected Totonac leadership as their help against the Aztec made them non-threatening militarily.
en-000001626	Evangelization was likewise slow, with only sixteen parishes in all of Totonacapan by 1750.
en-000001627	This means that until 1750, the political and social situation in Totonacapan was relatively stable.
en-000001628	Mestizos began to take indigenous land and felt sufficiently powerful enough to begin taking political and military power.
en-000001629	From 1750 to 1820, there were a series of Totonac revolts against these incursions, especially in the Papantla and Orizaba regions.
en-000001630	Borders fluctuated over this time but were set by the beginning of Mexican Revolution.
en-000001631	The Totonacs had some luck in turning the tide during the Mexican Revolution but these gains were lost in the 1930s.
en-000001632	The process of dividing Totonacapan into various smaller entities politically and economically continued through the 20th century.
en-000001633	One development was the construction of the Mexico City-Tuxpan highway and the development of petroleum extraction in the Poza Rica area.
en-000001634	A part of the Classic Veracruz culture, El Tajín flourished from 600 to 1200 C.E.
en-000001635	and during this time numerous temples, palaces, ballcourts, and pyramids were built.
en-000001636	This architecture includes the use of decorative niches and cement in forms unknown in the rest of Mesoamerica.
en-000001637	The next most important site is Cempoala which during the height of the Totonacs, was the most important city.
en-000001638	It was still important when the Spanish arrived, but it became mostly abandoned afterwards.
en-000001639	The area contains some of the earliest known archeological sites in Veracruz such as Trapiche, Chalahuite el Viejón, Limoncito and Tlalixcoyan.
en-000001640	Annual rainfall averages between 1,500 and 1,800mm per year with most falling between July and November.
en-000001641	The most important rivers include Cazones, Tecolutla and Necaxa, which is a tributary of the Tecolutla.
en-000001642	There are also numerous streams the largest of which include the Zozocolco, the Tecacán and the Chumatlán.
en-000001643	However, their range is limited to less than 4,000 hectares in about seven municipalities.
en-000001644	Wildlife includes squirrels, rabbits, armadillos, opossums, fresh and saltwater shrimp, trout, and various bird species.
en-000001645	Totonacapan is one of Mexico poorest regions, despite the fact that there is oil production in and around Poza Rica.
en-000001646	The reason is that much of the region is still isolated and rural.
en-000001647	Infrastructure such as roadways and housing is in poor condition especially in the mountain areas.
en-000001648	The principal economic activities are agriculture, the raising of cattle and in some areas, fishing.
en-000001649	The mountain areas principally grow coffee, black pepper, sapote and mamey.
en-000001650	Aside from cattle there is some other livestock such as pigs, sheep, horses and domestic fowl as well as bees.
en-000001651	When the Aztecs conquered Totonacapan, part of the tribute was in vanilla beans, mostly used to flavor chocolate drinks in Tenochtitlán.
en-000001652	Despite the quality due to ideal growing conditions, Mexico produces only fifteen percent of the world’s vanilla.
en-000001653	The main industry is related to oil and gas production although this is limited to the very north of the region.
en-000001654	Other than oil, gas, and other commodities, China has rather limited interests in Russia.
en-000001655	There are also some small industries dedicated to the production of bricks, piloncillo, furniture and handcrafts.
en-000001656	Papantla is the modern capital of Totonac culture, with a Volador pole in the atrium of the main church.
en-000001657	Zozocolca has various waterfalls surrounded by large and leafy trees and slabs of rock which guide the water.
en-000001658	It is one of the sites of the Cumbre Tajín annual festival.
en-000001659	Totonac languages are principally spoken in Veracruz, the north of Puebla and some areas of Hidalgo.
en-000001660	The percentage of ethnic Totonacs which speak the language is declining as parents stop teaching it to their children.
en-000001661	This phenomenon is more pronounced in the lowland areas where it has all but disappeared in some places.
en-000001662	The largest concentration of speakers is in Papantla with large concentrations on the Veracruz/Puebla border.
en-000001663	However, these dances are also waning and survive mostly in marginalized communities.
en-000001664	As older instructors die, there are no younger ones to take their place.
en-000001665	Much of the region’s cuisine is based on corn, along with wild and cultivated plants and fruits.
en-000001666	Small dishes include tlacoyos with beans, chili peppers with sesame seed, tamales with salted fish, turkey and other fillings, enchiladas zampadas.
en-000001667	Seafood dishes include shrimp in various preparations including with sesame seed and sweet potato and grilled fish.
en-000001668	Meats include various domestic fowl, pork, beef and rabbit, often smoked.
en-000001669	Most ingredients are indigenous with a few exceptions such as sesame seed and almonds.
en-000001670	Another common dish is zacahuil, which is a kind of corn pudding.
en-000001671	Another distinct ethnicity in the region is the Tepehua, whose language is similar to Totonac.
en-000001672	Centered on three sites over five days, the aim of the event is to promote Totonacapan’s culture, identity and economy.
en-000001673	The event had an economic impact of between 180 and 200 million pesos with over 400,000 visitors, temporarily employing 8,000 workers.
en-000001674	The event attracts over 5,000 artists from Veracruz, Mexico and the world with about the same number of activities.
en-000001675	Reconvilier is a municipality in the Jura bernois administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.
en-000001676	In 884, the village appears as an estate belonging to Moutier-Grandval Abbey.
en-000001677	The noble Reconvilier family appears in historical records beginning in the 12th century and lasting until the 15th.
en-000001678	The village remained under the Abbey's control until it was secularized around 1531.
en-000001679	Then Reconvilier came under the authority of the provost of Moutier-Grandval who represented the Prince-Bishop of Basel.
en-000001680	After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Reconvilier became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible.
en-000001681	Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin.
en-000001682	After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Reconvilier was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815.
en-000001683	The Chapel of Saint-Léonard in Chaindon is first mentioned in 962.
en-000001684	However, both Reconvilier and Chaindon were part of the parish of Tavannes for most of their history.
en-000001685	In 1530, the entire Tavannes parish, including Reconvilier converted to the new faith of the Protestant Reformation.
en-000001686	It separated from the parish to form an independent parish in 1908.
en-000001687	The current parish church was built as a village church in 1740.
en-000001688	Industry began to move into the village in the second half of the 19th century.
en-000001689	In 1851 the watch parts factory Bueche, Boillat et Cie opened.
en-000001690	In 1876 a station on the Basel-Biel railroad opened in Reconvilier.
en-000001691	The convenient transportation link allowed the village to expand into an important watchmaking center.
en-000001692	It sold watches under the Reconvilier Watch Company name until 1970.
en-000001693	In 1855, Bueche, Boillat et Cie built a foundry to supply metal to the company.
en-000001694	After passing through several different owners, it became part of Swissmetal in 1989.
en-000001695	Today the manufacturing sector still provides over half of all jobs in the municipality.
en-000001696	Most of the job losses in the tradable sector were in manufacturing industries, especially after the year 2000.
en-000001697	Of the agricultural land, 16.6% is used for growing crops and 14.3% is pastures and 13.2% is used for alpine pastures.
en-000001698	It consists of the village of Reconvilier and the hamlet of Chaindon.
en-000001699	On 31 December 2009 District de Moutier, the municipality's former district, was dissolved.
en-000001700	On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created Arrondissement administratif Jura bernois.
en-000001701	Over the last 10 years (2001-2011) the population has changed at a rate of-2.3%.
en-000001702	Migration accounted for-2.7%, while births and deaths accounted for-0.2%.
en-000001703	The entire urbanized village of Reconvilier is designated as part of the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites
en-000001704	In the 2011 federal election the most popular party was the Swiss People's Party (SVP) which received 32.7% of the vote.
en-000001705	In the federal election, a total of 580 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 39.5%.
en-000001706	In 2009 there were a total of 980 tax payers in the municipality.
en-000001707	There were 16 people who made between 15,000 and 20,000 per year.
en-000001708	In 2011 a total of 5.0% of the population received direct financial assistance from the government.
en-000001709	There were 63 (or about 2.61% of the population) who were Islamic.
en-000001710	There were 5 individuals who were Buddhist, 3 individuals who were Hindu and 5 individuals who belonged to another church.
en-000001711	The Canton of Bern school system provides one year of non-obligatory Kindergarten, followed by six years of Primary school.
en-000001712	This is followed by three years of obligatory lower Secondary school where the students are separated according to ability and aptitude.
en-000001713	Following the lower Secondary students may attend additional schooling or they may enter an apprenticeship.
en-000001714	During the 2011-12 school year, there were a total of 266 students attending classes in Reconvilier.
en-000001715	There were 3 kindergarten classes with a total of 40 students in the municipality.
en-000001716	During the same year, there were 5 lower secondary classes with a total of 81 students.
en-000001717	The Chernobyl disaster was the worst nuclear power plant accident in history in terms of cost and casualties.
en-000001718	These events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air, causing it to ignite.
en-000001719	The plumes drifted over large parts of the western Soviet Union and Europe.
en-000001720	According to official post-Soviet data, about 60% of the fallout landed in Belarus.
en-000001721	Many thousands of these evacuees would have been "better off staying home".
en-000001722	Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs, of the Chernobyl accident.
en-000001723	There was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new "startups", after 1986.
en-000001724	A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency examines the environmental consequences of the accident.
en-000001725	Thirty-one deaths are directly attributed to the accident, all among the reactor staff and emergency workers.
en-000001726	An UNSCEAR report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at 64 as of 2008.
en-000001727	Greenpeace itself advocates a figure of at least 200,000 or more.
en-000001728	It characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science.
en-000001729	The available statistical data excludes the Soviet/Ukraine/Belarus abortion rates, as they are presently unavailable.
en-000001730	In Greece, there was an observed 2500 excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated.
en-000001731	In Italy, a "slightly" above the expected number of induced abortions occurred, approximately 100.
en-000001732	On 26 April 1986, at 01:23 (UTC+3), reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase, leading to explosions in its core.
en-000001733	RBMK reactors like those at Chernobyl use water as a coolant.
en-000001734	This capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally, and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully.
en-000001735	The system was modified, and the test was repeated in 1984 but again proved unsuccessful.
en-000001736	In 1985, the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results.
en-000001737	The test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor.
en-000001738	The test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown.
en-000001739	Instead, it was approved only by the director of the plant (and even this approval was not consistent with established procedures).
en-000001740	The conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of 25 April 1986.
en-000001741	The day-shift workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures.
en-000001742	A special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system.
en-000001743	At 23:04, the Kiev grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume.
en-000001744	The night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment.
en-000001745	A further rapid decrease in the power level from 50% was executed during the shift change-over.
en-000001746	Toptunov was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months.
en-000001747	The test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor 4 to a thermal level of 700–1000 MW.
en-000001748	An output of 700 MW was reached at 00:05 on 26 April.
en-000001749	This combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended near-shutdown state, with a power output of 30 MW thermal or less.
en-000001750	The reactor was now producing 5 percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test.
en-000001751	Between 00:35 and 00:45, emergency alarm signals concerning thermal-hydraulic parameters were ignored, apparently to preserve the reactor power level.
en-000001752	When the power level of 200 MW was achieved, preparation for the experiment continued.
en-000001753	As part of the test plan, extra water pumps were activated at 01:05 on 26 April, increasing the water flow.
en-000001754	The flow exceeded the allowed limit at 01:19, triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators.
en-000001755	The reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers.
en-000001756	If anything pushed it into supercriticality, it was unable to recover automatically.
en-000001757	Four of the main circulating pumps (MCP) were active; of the eight total, six are normally active during regular operation.
en-000001758	The steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a run-down of the turbine generator.
en-000001759	In the interim, the power for the MCPs was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down.
en-000001760	As the momentum of the turbine generator decreased, so did the power it produced for the pumps.
en-000001761	The water flow rate decreased, leading to increased formation of steam voids (bubbles) in the core.
en-000001762	This caused yet more water to flash into steam, giving a further power increase.
en-000001763	This system had control of only 12 rods, and nearly all others had been manually retracted.
en-000001764	At 1:23:40, as recorded by the SKALA centralized control system, an emergency shutdown (SCRAM) of the reactor was initiated.
en-000001765	After the EPS-5 button was pressed, the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began.
en-000001766	The subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments; it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation.
en-000001767	Apparently, the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup, leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure.
en-000001768	Then, according to some estimations, the reactor jumped to around 30,000 MW thermal, ten times the normal operational output.
en-000001769	This is believed to be the first explosion that many heard.
en-000001770	The total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the reactor's thermal power.
en-000001771	This explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator.
en-000001772	According to observers outside Unit 4, burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor.
en-000001773	Some of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire.
en-000001774	About 25 percent of the red-hot graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected.
en-000001775	Parts of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building.
en-000001776	The air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite fire.
en-000001777	There were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion.
en-000001778	A third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion.
en-000001779	This second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building.
en-000001780	This nuclear excursion released 40 billion joules of energy, the equivalent of about ten tons of TNT.
en-000001781	The analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core.
en-000001782	Ejected material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor 3, which was still operating.
en-000001783	It was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor 3.
en-000001784	The operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working.
en-000001785	Approximate radiation intensity levels at different locations at Chernobyl reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table.
en-000001786	A dose of 500 roentgens (~5 Sv) delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings.
en-000001787	All remaining dosimeters had limits of 0.001 R/s and therefore read "off scale".
en-000001788	Because of the inaccurate low readings, the reactor crew chief Alexander Akimov assumed that the reactor was intact.
en-000001789	Shortly after the accident, firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires.
en-000001790	Grigorii Khmel, the driver of one of the fire engines, later described what happened:
en-000001791	Anatoli Zakharov, a fireman stationed in Chernobyl since 1980, offers a different description in 2008:
en-000001792	The fires were extinguished by 5:00, but many firefighters received high doses of radiation.
en-000001793	It is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core.
en-000001794	Equipment assembled included remote-controlled bulldozers and robot-carts that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris.
en-000001795	Where there was very high radiation, the robot ceased to be a robot—the electronics quit working."
en-000001796	With the exception of the fire contained inside Reactor 4, which continued to burn for many days.
en-000001797	The townspeople went about their usual business, completely oblivious to what had just happened.
en-000001798	As the plant was run by authorities in Moscow, the government of Ukraine did not receive prompt information on the accident.
en-000001799	A commission was set up the same day (26 April) to investigate the accident.
en-000001800	They flew to Boryspil International Airport and arrived at the power plant in the evening of 26 April.
en-000001801	By that time two people had already died and 52 were hospitalized.
en-000001802	In the early hours of 27 April, over 24 hours after the initial blast, they ordered the evacuation of Pripyat.
en-000001803	Initially it was decided to evacuate the population for three days; later this was made permanent.
en-000001804	By 11:00 on 27 April, buses had arrived in Pripyat to start the evacuation.
en-000001805	As a result, most personal belongings were left behind, and remain there today.
en-000001806	By 15:00, 53,000 people were evacuated to various villages of the Kiev region.
en-000001807	The next day, talks began for evacuating people from the 10 km zone.
en-000001808	Ten days after the accident, the evacuation area was expanded to 30 km (19 mi).
en-000001809	These evacuations actually had some economic benefit, moving people to areas of labour shortage in Belarus and Ukraine.
en-000001810	Evacuation began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the Union.
en-000001811	At 21:02 that evening a 20-second announcement was read in the TV news programme "Vremya":
en-000001812	Around the same time, ABC News released its report about the disaster.
en-000001813	Shevchenko was the first of the Ukrainian state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on 28 April.
en-000001814	Scientists were reporting that the radiological background in Kiev city was normal.
en-000001815	Several buildings in Pripyat were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant.
en-000001816	These included the Jupiter Factory which closed in 1996 and the Azure Swimming Pool which closed in 1998.
en-000001817	The bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates.
en-000001818	However the valves controlling it were underwater, located in a flooded corridor in the basement.
en-000001819	Some sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant.
en-000001820	Alexei Ananenko continues to work in the nuclear energy industry, and rebuffs the growth of the Chernobyl media sensationalism surrounding him.
en-000001821	Once the bubbler pool gates were opened by the Ananenko team, fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement.
en-000001822	The operation was not completed until 8 May, after 20,000 metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out.
en-000001823	With the bubbler pool gone, a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion.
en-000001824	To do so, the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor.
en-000001825	Using oil drilling equipment, the injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 May.
en-000001826	It was estimated that 25 metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at −100 °C.
en-000001827	By December 1986, a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents.
en-000001828	Many of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the Chernobyl area.
en-000001829	These scientists manually collected cold fuel rods, but great heat was still emanating from the core.
en-000001830	The scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust.
en-000001831	The mass was composed of sand, glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor.
en-000001832	The concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot, and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite.
en-000001833	It was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion.
en-000001834	Liquidators worked under deplorable conditions, poorly informed and with poor protections.
en-000001835	The official contaminated zones became stage to a massive clean-up effort lasting seven months.
en-000001836	The first official explanation of the accident, later acknowledged to be erroneous, was published in August 1986.
en-000001837	In this view, the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations.
en-000001838	Serious critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident.
en-000001839	One was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night.
en-000001840	The reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators, which the test was really about.
en-000001841	Normally the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods.
en-000001842	All control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators.
en-000001843	This report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident, presented in Appendix I.
en-000001844	Turning off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations.
en-000001845	Human factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster.
en-000001846	The 1986 assertions of Soviet experts notwithstanding, regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level.
en-000001847	However, regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity.
en-000001848	Both views were heavily lobbied by different groups, including the reactor's designers, power plant personnel, and the Soviet and Ukrainian governments.
en-000001849	According to the IAEA's 1986 analysis, the main cause of the accident was the operators'actions.
en-000001850	But according to the IAEA's 1993 revised analysis the main cause was the reactor's design.
en-000001851	Once again, the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident.
en-000001852	INSAG's view is that it was the operating crew's deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame.
en-000001853	Four hundred times more radioactive material was released from Chernobyl than by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
en-000001854	Approximately 100,000 km² of land was significantly contaminated with fallout, with the worst hit regions being in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.
en-000001855	Slighter levels of contamination were detected over all of Europe except for the Iberian Peninsula.
en-000001856	Sweden and Norway also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front, bringing rain.
en-000001857	However, the 2006 TORCH report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.
en-000001858	A large area in Russia south of Bryansk was also contaminated, as were parts of northwestern Ukraine.
en-000001859	Studies in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation.
en-000001860	Resettlement may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules.
en-000001861	In France some officials stated that the Chernobyl accident had no adverse effects.
en-000001862	Iodine-131 and caesium-137 are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population.
en-000001863	At different times after the accident, different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose.
en-000001864	(Some radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive, which is not accounted for here.)
en-000001865	Two sizes of particles were released: small particles of 0.3 to 1.5 micrometres (aerodynamic diameter) and large particles of 10 micrometres.
en-000001866	The dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open.
en-000001867	Despite this, two months after the disaster the Kiev water supply was abruptly switched from the Dnieper to the Desna River.
en-000001868	Guideline maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately 1000 Bq/kg in the European Union.
en-000001869	In the Kiev Reservoir in Ukraine, concentrations in fish were several thousand Bq/kg during the years after the accident.
en-000001870	Although there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites off-site (i.e.
en-000001871	Some animals in the worst-hit areas also died or stopped reproducing.
en-000001872	Some cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage.
en-000001873	This was due to residual radioactivity from Chernobyl in the plants they graze on in the wild during the summer.
en-000001874	The report says it represents the consensus view of the eight UN organizations.
en-000001875	Of all 66,000 Belarusian emergency workers, by the mid-1990s only 150 (roughly 0.2%) were reported by their government as having died.
en-000001876	Health in Belarus and Ukraine has shown disturbing trends following the Chernobyl disaster.
en-000001877	Many of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones, or former or current Chernobyl plant workers.
en-000001878	These bio-robots are well-known figures within every village, housing block and work-collective.
en-000001879	Most are prematurely aged and many have died, and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider population.
en-000001880	Under Soviet rule, the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered up.
en-000001881	Both Belarus and Ukraine rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster.
en-000001882	Health-related government welfare was blamed for creating "the sense of victimization and dependency" and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders.
en-000001883	It said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected population.
en-000001884	Dr Michael Repacholi, manager of WHO's Radiation Program reported that the 4000 cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths.
en-000001885	According to UNSCEAR, up to the year 2005, an excess of over 6000 cases of thyroid cancer have been reported.
en-000001886	They concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure.
en-000001887	However, the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the Chernobyl accident is still high according to published studies.
en-000001888	The report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation.
en-000001889	The IAEA says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects.
en-000001890	To reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise."
en-000001891	The number of potential deaths arising from the Chernobyl disaster is heavily debated.
en-000001892	The Scientific Secretary of the Chernobyl Forum criticized the report's reliance on non-peer-reviewed locally produced studies.
en-000001893	"Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment " is an English translation of the 2007 Russian publication"Chernobyl".
en-000001894	In Greece, following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation.
en-000001895	A "slightly" above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in Italy.
en-000001896	Another significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the Chernobyl accident.
en-000001897	It is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster.
en-000001898	In Belarus the total cost over 30 years is estimated at US$235 billion (in 2005 dollars).
en-000001899	Much of the current cost relates to the payment of Chernobyl-related social benefits to some 7 million people across the 3 countries.
en-000001900	In Ukraine, over 500,000 people have now been resettled, many of whom have become applicants for medical and other welfare.
en-000001901	Many of these workers have since registered disabilities and enrolled for welfare.
en-000001902	Ukraine has since developed a massive and burdensome welfare system that has become increasingly corrupt and ineffective.
en-000001903	Following the accident, questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate.
en-000001904	All work on the unfinished reactors 5 and 6 was halted three years later.
en-000001905	However, the trouble at the Chernobyl plant did not end with the disaster in reactor 4.
en-000001906	The Ukrainian government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country.
en-000001907	On 15 December 2000, then-President Leonid Kuchma personally turned off Reactor 3 in an official ceremony, shutting down the entire site.
en-000001908	This was delayed again to 2016, the end of the 30-year lifespan of the sarcophagus.
en-000001909	The structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails.
en-000001910	4 has been covered by the New Safe Confinement that covers the reactor and the unstable“sarcophagus”.
en-000001911	A handful of Ukrainian scientists work inside the sarcophagus, but outsiders are rarely granted access.
en-000001912	At first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it.
en-000001913	A proposed reinforcement in 2005 was cancelled by a superior official.
en-000001914	After the 12 February incident, radioactivity levels were up to 19 becquerels per cubic meter of air: 12 times normal.
en-000001915	The report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed.
en-000001916	According to Kupny the situation was underestimated by the Chernobyl nuclear complex managers, and information was kept secret.
en-000001917	This facility, treating 2500 fuel assemblies per year, would be the first of its kind for RBMK fuel.
en-000001918	The interim spent fuel storage facility (ISF-2) will now be completed by others by mid-2013.
en-000001919	This will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on site.
en-000001920	Three different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building: black, brown, and a porous ceramic.
en-000001921	The lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them.
en-000001922	The porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly.
en-000001923	It is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity.
en-000001924	The paper also states that when the shelter is improved, the leaching rate of the lava will decrease.
en-000001925	It is largely uninhabited, except for about 300 residents who have refused to leave.
en-000001926	The Chernobyl Shelter Fund was established in 1997 at the Denver 23rd G8 summit to finance the Shelter Implementation Plan (SIP).
en-000001927	While the original cost estimate for the SIP was US$768 million, the 2006 estimate was $1.2 billion.
en-000001928	The NSC is expected to be completed in 2015, and will be the largest movable structure ever built.
en-000001929	CRDP works in the four most Chernobyl-affected areas in Ukraine: Kyivska, Zhytomyrska, Chernihivska and Rivnenska.
en-000001930	These funds were divided between Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, the three main affected countries, for further investigation of health effects.
en-000001931	The organization's founder and chief executive is Adi Roche, the Irish humanitarian and peace campaigner.
en-000001932	The CCI was founded in 1991 in response to an appeal from Ukrainian and Belarusian doctors for aid.
en-000001933	Roche then began organizing'rest and recuperation'holidays for a few Chernobyl children.
en-000001934	Recruiting Irish families who would welcome and care for them, CCI expanded into the United States in 2001.
en-000001935	Over its lifetime, the organization has grown in strength and numbers.
en-000001936	Journalists mistrusted many professionals (such as the spokesman from the UK NRPB), and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them.
en-000001937	In Italy, the Chernobyl accident was reflected in the outcome of the 1987 referendum.
en-000001938	A referendum in 2011 reiterated Italians'strong objections to nuclear power, thus abrogating the government's decision of 2008.
en-000001939	As long ago as 1973, the US government itself saw that Iran would need nuclear power.
en-000001940	The minister was given the authority over reactor safety as well, which the current minister still holds as of 2015.
en-000001941	The source documents relating to the emergency, published in unofficial sources:
en-000001942	Abe served for a year as Prime Minister, from 2006 to 2007.
en-000001943	Following the LDP's landslide victory in the 2012 general election, Abe became the Prime Minister again.
en-000001944	Abe is the first former Prime Minister to return to the office since Shigeru Yoshida in 1948.
en-000001945	Abe was re-elected at the 2014 general election, retaining his two-thirds majority with coalition partner Komeito.
en-000001946	His family is originally from Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Abe's registered residence ("honseki chi") is Nagato, Yamaguchi, where his grandfather was born.
en-000001947	His grandfather, Kan Abe, and father, Shintaro Abe, were both politicians.
en-000001948	Abe's mother, Yoko Kishi, is the daughter of Nobusuke Kishi, prime minister of Japan from 1957 to 1960.
en-000001949	Kishi had been a member of the Tōjō Cabinet during the Second World War.
en-000001950	Since GHQ's policy changed and became more anti-communist, Kishi was released from Sugamo Prison, and later established the Japan Democratic Party.
en-000001951	Because of that experience, I may have become emotionally attached to'conservatism', on the contrary".
en-000001952	In 1955, Shigeru Yoshida's Liberal Party and Kishi's Democratic Party merged as an anti-leftist coalition and was reestablished as the LDP.
en-000001953	Abe attended Seikei Elementary School, Seikei Junior High School and Seikei Senior High School.
en-000001954	He studied public administration and graduated with the Bachelor's degree in Political Science from Seikei University in 1977.
en-000001955	Abe is a member of the Mori Faction (formally, the Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyū-kai) of the Liberal Democratic Party.
en-000001956	From 1986 to 1991, Abe's father, Shintaro, headed the same faction.
en-000001957	The Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyū-kai has 60 members in the House of Representatives and 26 in the House of Councillors.
en-000001958	The perpetrators were several yakuza members belonging to the Kudo-kai, a Kitakyushu-based designated boryokudan syndicate.
en-000001959	Abe was chief negotiator for the Japanese government on behalf of the families of Japanese abductees taken to North Korea.
en-000001960	As a part of the effort, he accompanied Koizumi to meet Kim Jong‑il in 2002.
en-000001961	He gained national popularity when he demanded that Japanese abductees visiting Japan remain, in defiance of North Korea.
en-000001962	The team sought to provide contrast to the Democratic Party of Japan, which it alleged supported such policies.
en-000001963	On September 20, 2006, Abe was elected as the president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
en-000001964	His chief competitors for the position were Sadakazu Tanigaki and Tarō Asō.
en-000001965	Yasuo Fukuda was a leading early contender but ultimately chose not to run.
en-000001966	Former Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori, to whose faction both Abe and Fukuda belonged, stated that the faction strongly leant toward Abe.
en-000001967	Abe, elected at age 52, was the youngest prime minister since Fumimaro Konoe in 1941.
en-000001968	Abe expressed a general commitment to the fiscal reforms instituted by his predecessor, Jun'ichirō Koizumi.
en-000001969	North Korea criticized this Japanese decision as a breach of a diplomatic promise, and the negotiations aborted.
en-000001970	Abe has also said that China–Japan relations should not continue to be based on emotions.
en-000001971	Occasionally, Abe is respected among politicians in Taiwan who are part of the Pan-Green Coalition seeking Taiwanese independence.
en-000001972	Abe has expressed the need to strengthen political, security, and economic ties within the Southeast Asian region.
en-000001973	Abe has increased its allies in its international campaign to counter the North Korean nuclear cards.
en-000001974	However, relations with China continue to be tarnished by the Senkaku Islands dispute and Abe's visits to Yasukuni shrine (see below).
en-000001975	Abe, in his two terms as the prime minister of Japan, sought to upgrade the strategic Japan-India relationship.
en-000001976	Abe initiated the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between Japan, the United States, Australia and India in 2007.
en-000001977	A sixth link of the India-Australia would be the logical corollary, formalized as a new quadrilateral of strategic bulwark.
en-000001978	Chinese strategic experts have labelled the evolving geo-strategic paradigm, the "Asian NATO".
en-000001979	Abe's pragmatic India foreign policy, is to boost Japan's resurgent economic indicators, while gaining a crucial partner in Asia.
en-000001980	India, unlike most major Far-Eastern and ASEAN states, does not have a history of serious military dispute with Japan.
en-000001981	During his first period as prime minister he upgraded the Japan Defense Agency to full ministry status.
en-000001982	Like his predecessors, he supported the Japanese alliance with the United States.
en-000001983	Another agricultural minister, Norihiko Akagi, who was involved in a political funding scandal, resigned after the election.
en-000001984	In an attempt to revive his administration, Abe announced a new cabinet on 27 August 2007.
en-000001985	However, the new agricultural minister Takehiko Endo, involved in a finance scandal, resigned only 7 days later.
en-000001986	Party officials also said the embattled prime minister was suffering from poor health.
en-000001987	On 26 September 2007 Abe officially ended his term as Yasuo Fukuda became the new prime minister of Japan.
en-000001988	In the elections on 16 December 2012, the LDP won 294 seats in the 480 seat House of Representatives.
en-000001989	Abe maintained pressure on the Bank's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, who was reluctant to set specific targets, into agreeing to the policy.
en-000001990	The budget also increased defense spending and manpower while reducing foreign aid.
en-000001991	This move was partly in response to the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and the bill faced little opposition in the Diet.
en-000001992	This situation, known as the "Twisted Diet", had contributed to political gridlock and the "revolving door" of Prime Ministers since 2007.
en-000001993	Political corruption, exemplified by the revolving door between Spain’s government and financial sector, was endemic.
en-000001994	In 2013 Abe supported the creation of the Super Global Universities program.
en-000001995	This is a ten-year program to increase international student attendance in Japanese universities and hire more foreign faculty.
en-000001996	There is also funding for selected universities to create English-only undergraduate programs.
en-000001997	Abe condemned the killings as "absolutely unforgivable" and confirmed that Japan and Britain had co-operated over the incident.
en-000001998	This followed a similar agreement with French ministers in Tokyo earlier in the year.
en-000001999	He was the first Japanese PM to address the Australian parliament.
en-000002000	He offered Japan's support to other countries in resolving territorial disputes.
en-000002001	Relations between Japan and its immediate neighbours, China and South Korea, remained poor after Abe's return to office.
en-000002002	Neither did Abe hold any meetings with President Park Geun-hye of Korea during his 2012-14 term of office.
en-000002003	In December 2013, Abe announced a five-year plan of military expansion.
en-000002004	He described this as "proactive pacificism", with the goal of making Japan a more "normal" country, able to defend itself.
en-000002005	This was in reaction to a Chinese buildup and a decreased American influence in the region.
en-000002006	In the same month the Diet passed the Abe cabinet's State Secrecy Law, which took effect in December 2014.
en-000002007	In July 2014 the Abe cabinet took the decision to re-interpret Japan's constitution to allow for the right of "Collective Self-Defense".
en-000002008	This led to the introduction of the 2015 security legislation to give legal effect to the cabinet's decision (see below).
en-000002009	The reshuffled cabinet tied the record of 5 women ministers set by the first Koizumi cabinet.
en-000002010	Abe described the election as the "Abenomics Dissolution" and asked the voters to pass judgement on his economic policies.
en-000002011	The opposition parties attempted to field a united front in opposition to Abe's policies, but found themselves divided on them.
en-000002012	In the elections, the LDP won 291 seats, a loss of 3, but the Komeito gained 4 to win 35.
en-000002013	Therefore, the governing coalition maintained its two thirds majority in a slightly-reduced lower house of 475.
en-000002014	Both hostages were killed, ISIL releasing news of Yukawa's death on January 24 and Goto's on January 31.
en-000002015	In April 2015, he addressed a joint sitting of the U.S. Congress, the first Japanese prime minister to do so.
en-000002016	During the visit, Abe attended a state dinner at the White House.
en-000002017	The summits had been suspended in 2012 due to tensions over historical and territorial issues.
en-000002018	Japan's relations with South Korea have improved somewhat during Abe's third term, in the aftermath of Abe's war anniversary statement.
en-000002019	Both sides agreed to refrain from criticising each other over the issue in the future.
en-000002020	The bills passed the House of Representatives on July 16 with the support of the majority LDP-Komeito coalition.
en-000002021	Abe countered by arguing that the bills had been debated for "as many as 113 hours" before the vote.
en-000002022	Many protested the legislation outside the Diet buildings, denouncing what were referred to as "war bills" by opponents.
en-000002023	Organisers of the protests estimated that up to 100,000 protesters marched against the bills'passage of the lower house in July.
en-000002024	He also pledged to continue to explain the legislation to try to gain "greater understanding" from the public on the issue.
en-000002025	Following the bills'passage, Abe was expected to once again return his focus to economic issues.
en-000002026	He also promised to mitigate any negative effects on the Japanese agricultural sector.
en-000002027	Abe declared the tax deal to be "the best possible result" of the negotiations.
en-000002028	Affiliated to the openly revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi, Shinzo Abe consistently defends its agenda.
en-000002029	The British journalist Rupert Wingfield-Hayes of BBC described him as "far more right wing than most of his predecessors."
en-000002030	Later in the session, Abe stated his belief that Class A war criminals are not criminals under Japan's domestic law.
en-000002031	I think we have to wait for the estimation of historians'.
en-000002032	However, on a TV program in July 2006 he denied that Manchukuo was a puppet state.
en-000002033	The Korean and Chinese governments, as well as noted academics and commentators, have voiced concern about Abe's historical views.
en-000002034	What part of'Japanese Army sex slaves'does Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, have so much trouble understanding and apologizing for?
en-000002035	The Japanese Army's involvement is documented in the government's own defense files.
en-000002036	America isn't the only country interested in seeing Japan belatedly accept full responsibility.
en-000002037	[South] Korea and China are also infuriated by years of Japanese equivocations over the issue.
en-000002038	The same editorial presented him as a revisionist, a view largely accepted by the international and part of the Japanese press.
en-000002039	The "tribunal" was a private committee to adjudicate comfort women; about 5,000 people including 64 victims from Japan and abroad attended.
en-000002040	Abe said in a press conference, "It is a truly big problem if they want to injure my political life".
en-000002041	Morimoto was arrested for allegedly groping a woman on the train.
en-000002042	Images of this blunder can now be seen clearly across the Internet, Have the slander campaigns already begun!?
en-000002043	Neither Abe nor his office have received any form of apology.
en-000002044	He initially refrained from visiting the shrine as a sitting prime minister.
en-000002045	It was the first visit to the shrine by a sitting prime minister since Junichiro Koizumi visited in August 2006.
en-000002046	In 2015, Abe's government refused to admit refugees affected by conflicts in the Middle East and Africa.
en-000002047	Abe stated that Japan must solve its own problems before accepting any immigrants.
en-000002048	In addition to the cabinet positions existing under Koizumi, Abe created five new "advisor" positions.
en-000002049	Abe married Akie Matsuzaki, a socialite and former radio disk jockey, in 1987.
en-000002050	She is the daughter of the president of Morinaga, a chocolate manufacturer.
en-000002051	She is popularly known as the "domestic opposition party" due to her outspoken views, which often contradict her husband's.
en-000002052	The couple have no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments earlier in their marriage.
en-000002053	Commentators have discussed the likely effects of the disaster on a wide range of political issues.
en-000002054	This will entail providing a coordinated, comprehensive federal response to any large-scale crisis and mounting a swift and effective recovery effort".
en-000002055	Whatever Europe’s problem, a response that entails waste on this scale cannot be the solution.
en-000002056	Hospitals, nursing homes, group homes, were supposed to have pre-determined evacuation and/or refuge plans in place.
en-000002057	Foreign nationals without transport claimed that the police refused to evacuate them, giving bus places only to American citizens.
en-000002058	Prior to this, on August 27 the White House issued a statement, effective August 26, authorizing federal emergency assistance for Louisiana.
en-000002059	The President had not yet authorized FEMA to enter the coastal areas despite the governor's request including those parishes.
en-000002060	It was known that many residents of New Orleans lacked cars.
en-000002061	Even so, a 2000 census revealed that 27% of New Orleans households, amounting to approximately 120,000 people, were without privately owned transportation.
en-000002062	Additionally, at 38%, New Orleans has one of the highest poverty rates in the United States.
en-000002063	These factors may have prevented many people from being able to evacuate on their own.
en-000002064	Consequently, most of those stranded in the city are the poor, the elderly, and the sick.
en-000002065	State and city evacuation plans (Part 1 Section C and part II-2) mention use of school buses for evacuation.
en-000002066	With the following language:"The primary means of hurricane evacuation will be personal vehicles.
en-000002067	The precise number of buses available has been cited anywhere from a few hundred to a likely exaggerated 2,000.
en-000002068	During an emergency any driver is suitable as long as approved by the Governor.
en-000002069	Local municipalities were designated the responsibility for maintenance once the projects were complete (source: GAO testimony summary attached).
en-000002070	When authorized, this Congressional mandate was projected to take 13 years to complete.
en-000002071	The levees themselves were designed to protect New Orleans from a direct hit by a Category 3 hurricane.
en-000002072	However, when Hurricane Katrina passed east of New Orleans, it was a weakening Category 4 storm.
en-000002073	As a result, Blumenthal said, the Corps had performed only last-minute and substandard reinforcement of levees, some of which subsequently failed.
en-000002074	Other questions have been raised about the design of the flood protection system itself.
en-000002075	Berkeley and Team Louisiana cite inadequate design throughout the entire levee system.
en-000002076	There has been criticism of the federal policy, since 2003, of again turning wetlands over to developers.
en-000002077	Scientists estimate that every 2.7 miles of wetlands absorbs one foot of storm surge."
en-000002078	The Bush Administration, contrary to campaign promises and a wetland protection policy maintained since 1990, ended federal wetlands protection.
en-000002079	This and other reports suggest that the hurricane will have demographic consequences, particularly in and around Louisiana.
en-000002080	Louisiana lost one vote in the Electoral College following the 2010 U.S. Census.
en-000002081	President Bush was criticized for appointing Michael D. Brown as FEMA head.
en-000002082	Halliburton received reconstruction and damage assessment contracts for naval facilities in Mississippi and New Orleans affected by Katrina.
en-000002083	That work is being done under a $500 million contract with the Defense Department.
en-000002084	Shaw is a client of Joe M. Allbaugh, a consultant with extensive emergency disaster training and was a former FEMA director.
en-000002085	Shaw's CEO was chairman of Louisiana's Democratic party at the time.
en-000002086	The Shaw group and Jim Bernhard is/was also a major supporter and contributor to Gov.
en-000002087	Bernhard has since resigned as his position as the Louisiana as Chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party.
en-000002088	Even though asset prices had visibly collapsed by early 1992, the economy's decline continued for more than a decade.
en-000002089	This decline resulted in a huge accumulation of non-performing assets loans (NPL), causing difficulties for many financial institutions.
en-000002090	The bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble contributed to what many call the Lost Decade.
en-000002091	Simultaneously, the BOJ declared that curbing the yen’s appreciation was a“national priority”.
en-000002092	The course only reversed by the spring of 1988, when the US dollar began to strengthen against the yen.
en-000002093	Later, BOJ hinted at the possibility of tightening the policy due to inflationary pressures within the domestic economy.
en-000002094	Nonetheless, Black Monday in the US triggered a delay for the BOJ to switch to a monetary tightening policy.
en-000002095	The BOJ officially increased the discount rate on March 31, 1989.
en-000002096	The table below demonstrates the monthly average of the U.S. dollar/Yen spot rate (Yen per USD) at 17:00 JST.
en-000002097	These six major cities experienced far greater asset price inflation compared to other urban land nationwide.
en-000002098	Nationwide, statistics showed that commercial land, residential land, and industrial land prices were up by 80.9%, 51.1%, and 51.7%, respectively.
en-000002099	By the early 1980s, Tokyo was an important commercial city due to a high concentration of international financial corporations and interests.
en-000002100	By 1985, lands within Tokyo commercial districts were unable to fulfill the market demand.
en-000002101	As a result, land prices in Tokyo commercial districts increased sharply within a year.
en-000002102	metre for land in Tokyo commercial districts in 1984 was 1,333,000¥ (U$5,600 assuming in 1984 that 1 U$=238¥).
en-000002103	metre for land in Tokyo commercial districts increased to 1,894,000¥ (U$7,958 assuming in 1985 average 1 U$=238¥).
en-000002104	Osaka also experienced a rapid growth in land prices, especially in commercial districts.
en-000002105	Land prices in Osaka gained 35% to a price of 1,159,000¥/1 sq.
en-000002106	By 1987, virtually all land within the Tokyo metropolis was unable to cope with demand.
en-000002107	At this point, residential land in Tokyo increased to 890,000¥/1 sq.
en-000002108	metre (U$6,180 based on the assumption 1U$ = 144¥) and commercial land 6,493,000¥/1 sq.
en-000002109	Consequently, investors flocked to prefectures surrounding the Tokyo metropolis, especially prefectures within the Greater Tokyo Area.
en-000002110	Prefectures located in Southern Kanto were more favourable to investors compared to Northern Kanto.
en-000002111	For instance, in 1987, commercial land prices in Yokohama (average 1 sq.
en-000002112	On the other hand, commercial land prices in Mito (average 1 sq.
en-000002113	metre) were 153,000¥, Utsunomiya were 179,000¥ and Maebashi were 135,000¥ in 1986.
en-000002114	Osaka continued to enjoy an increase in land prices especially in the commercial area, as the prices increased to 2,025,000¥/1 sq.
en-000002115	The first sign of a possible bubble collapse appeared in 1988.
en-000002116	Prime land in Ginza district and areas in Central Tokyo continued to rise.
en-000002117	Urban land in other cities at this point remained unaffected by the situation faced by the Tokyo metropolis.
en-000002118	In Osaka, for instance, the commercial and residential land prices increased by 37% and 41% respectively.
en-000002119	Yokohama (Kanagawa prefecture) experienced a slowdown due to its location closer to Tokyo.
en-000002120	Saitama (Saitama) and Chiba (Chiba) still chalked up healthy gain in land prices.
en-000002121	All other urban cities in Japan had yet to see the impact of slowdown in Tokyo.
en-000002122	Between 1990 and mid-1991, most urban land had already reached the peak.
en-000002123	The bubble collapse were officially declared in early 1992– as land prices dropped the most in this period.
en-000002124	Tokyo experienced the worst from the catastrophic in Japanese economic history.
en-000002125	Land prices in residential area on average 1 sq/metre slid 19% while commercial land prices declined 13% compared to 1991.
en-000002126	Overall land prices in residential area and commercial districts in Tokyo fell to the lowest level since 1987.
en-000002127	Looking at the monthly performance of Nikkei 225 in 1984, the index largely moved within 9900-11,600 range.
en-000002128	As land prices in Tokyo began to rise in 1985, the stock market also moved higher.
en-000002129	Indeed, the Nikkei 225 managed to rise past 13,000 by December 2, 1985.
en-000002130	The major surge was obvious by 1986, as the Nikkei 225 gained close to 45% within a year.
en-000002131	This translated to a gain of more than 224% since January 2, 1985.
en-000002132	As long as the asset prices continued to strengthen, investors would more likely be attracted to speculate on stock prices.
en-000002133	On the downside, the tightening of monetary policy in 1989 seemed to affect stock prices.
en-000002134	What monetary policy can do is create asset-price bubbles.
en-000002135	The downward trend continued into 1991 as the Nikkei 225 slid to as low as 22,687 on November 1, 1991.
en-000002136	The trend was gradually reversed as it accelerated afterwards and exceeded 10 percent in April–June 1987.
en-000002137	The growth of credit was more conspicuous than that of the money supply.
en-000002138	The BoJ had slashed the official discount rate from 5.00% (January 30, 1986) to 2.50% (February 23, 1987).
en-000002139	The Bank of Japan has also been criticized for its role in fueling the asset bubble.
en-000002140	Japan has one of the world's most complicated taxation systems, with its property tax provisions deserving specific mention.
en-000002141	These provisions have been widely abused for speculation and have contributed to costlier land, especially within urban areas.
en-000002142	The Japanese property tax stipulated that the statutory standard property tax stood at 1.4%.
en-000002143	However, in terms of effective property tax, it is much lower than the published statutory property tax.
en-000002144	In the 1980s, local government imposed a tax on the market price land.
en-000002145	As a result, the Greater Tokyo area dropped to 0.06% of the market price.
en-000002146	As provided under the Japan Civil Code, the rights of a lessee and tenant are protected under the Land Lease Law.
en-000002147	For this reason, land leasehold contracts automatically renew unless the landlord provides concrete reasoning to object.
en-000002148	However, major firms were not keen to utilize the bank as the source of funding.
en-000002149	For this reason, banks were forced to aggressively promote loans to smaller firms backed by properties.
en-000002150	Soon, especially around 1987-1988, banks were even more apt to lend to individuals backed by properties.
en-000002151	Consequently, this had an adverse impact on whole Japanese asset bubble.
en-000002152	Firstly, cheap and easily available loans reduced the funding costs for the purpose of speculation.
en-000002153	Second, stock rises, coupled by low interests rates, reduced the capital costs and aided financing the capital market (e.g.
en-000002154	The asset price burst seemed to exert a strong impact on the overall Japanese economy.
en-000002155	By 1992, urban land prices nationwide declined 1.7% from the peak.
en-000002156	Commercial, residential and industrial land prices dropped 15.2%, 17.9%, and 13.1%, respectively.
en-000002157	The entire asset price crisis was far worse, especially in the large business districts of Tokyo.
en-000002158	However, since 2012, Tokyo is once again the world's most expensive city, followed by Osaka with Moscow as number 4.
en-000002159	The entire crisis also badly affected direct consumption and investment within Japan.
en-000002160	The asset price burst also badly affected consumer confidence since a sharp dip reduced household real income.
en-000002161	By 11 March 2003, it plunged to the post-bubble low of 7,862 on March 11, 2003.
en-000002162	During the asset bubble period, most Japanese corporate balance sheets were backed by assets.
en-000002163	An important effect of the bubble collapse was the deterioration of balance sheets.
en-000002164	Since asset prices tumbled, increasing liabilities on a long term basis projected a bad balance sheet to investors.
en-000002165	It has over 170 woodlands covering 28.27 km (6985 acres), 78 public parks covering 18.30 km (4522 acres) and 10 public gardens.
en-000002166	Sheffield also has more types of habitat than any city in the UK.
en-000002167	As well as urban, parkland and woodland it has agricultural and arable land, moors, meadows and freshwater based habitats.
en-000002168	Large parts of the city are designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest including several urban areas.
en-000002169	Historically, Sheffield was part of the West Riding of Yorkshire and, before this, the Saxon shire of Hallamshire.
en-000002170	This area is now part of the county of South Yorkshire, and borders on Nottinghamshire's forests and the Derbyshire Dales.
en-000002171	The city lies directly next to Rotherham with the M1 designating much of the border between them.
en-000002172	Although Barnsley Metropoliton Borough also borders Sheffield to the north, the town itself is a few miles further.
en-000002173	Carboniferous rocks in Europe generally consist of a repeated sequence of limestone and/or sandstone, shale and coal beds.
en-000002174	The Carboniferous coal beds provided much of the fuel for power generation during the Industrial Revolution.
en-000002175	(Another natural source of fuel in the area was peat, the neighbouring peat moors having started forming around 10,000 years ago).
en-000002176	Associated with the Upper Coal Measures were valuable iron ore deposits, occurring in the form of nodules.
en-000002177	Large quantities of locally occurring fireclay were also exploited, as well as ganister (a clay used to make refractory furnace linings).
en-000002178	(Totley Brook passes south of Totley and meets Old Hay Brook at Needham's Dyke).
en-000002179	The Sheaf flows northwards to join the River Don near Blonk Street Bridge in the city centre.
en-000002180	From here it flows eastward to meet the Sheaf, at a point now located underneath Sheffield Midland Station.
en-000002181	The river's major tributaries are the Loxley, the Rivelin, the Sheaf, the Rother and the Dearne.
en-000002182	Its main tributaries are the River Drone, the River Hipper and the River Doe Lea.
en-000002183	The village of Sheffield dates back to before the beginning of the last millennium.
en-000002184	It grew around a fortified building (later a castle) located at the confluence of the rivers Sheaf and Don.
en-000002185	By the 18th century Sheffield had become a thriving market town and was already the country's leading cutlery producer.
en-000002186	With the coming of industrial revolution Sheffield became one of England's fastest growing towns.
en-000002187	It grew over ten times in size to 400,000 within the 19th century.
en-000002188	China is ten times the size of Japan, and Japan was not easy to deal with, either.
en-000002189	However, this expansion had a devastating impact on the surrounding area.
en-000002190	Smog became a regular occurrence especially in the city centre that was at the bottom of a natural bowl.
en-000002191	The River Don became one of the most polluted rivers in Europe.
en-000002192	These areas saw a large decline during the 1970s and 1980s.
en-000002193	However most of the new developments, such as Meadowhall Centre, are in the service industry.
en-000002194	The largest park is Graves Park at 0.83 km, closely followed by Endcliffe Park.
en-000002195	Sheffield is made up of numerous districts that vary widely in size and history.
en-000002196	Many of these districts developed from villages or hamlets that have become absorbed into Sheffield as the city has grown.
en-000002197	The largest such district is Stocksbridge and Deepcar, which contains around 13,500 people.
en-000002198	Like the rest of the United Kingdom, the climate in Sheffield is generally temperate.
en-000002199	July was also the hottest month, with an average maximum temperature of 20.8 °C.
en-000002200	The average minimum temperature in January and February was 1.6 °C.
en-000002201	Due to the differences in altitude, the weather can be vastly different over various parts of the city.
en-000002202	Deepcar and Stocksbridge tend to be among the first to receive snowfall and get heavier downpours.
en-000002203	""Sheffield is fortunate to have one of the strongest green structures of any city in the UK.
en-000002204	This green structure, which at its core is linked by watercourses, underlies the City.
en-000002205	The location of the Chera capital is generally assumed to be at modern Karur (identified with the Korura of Ptolemy).
en-000002206	The Cheras were in continuous conflict with the neighbouring Cholas and Pandyas.
en-000002207	The Cheras are said to have defeated the combined armies of the Pandyas and the Cholas and their ally states.
en-000002208	They also made battles with the Kadambās of Banavasi and the Yavanas (the Greeks) on the Indian coast.
en-000002209	After the 2nd century CE, the Cheras'power decayed rapidly with the decline of the lucrative trade with the Romans.
en-000002210	Sangam literature describes a long line of Chera rulers dated to the first few centuries CE.
en-000002211	It records the names of the kings, the princes, and the court poets who extolled them.
en-000002212	Uthiyan Cheralathan, Nedum Cheralathan and Senguttuvan Chera are some of the rulers referred to in the Sangam poems.
en-000002213	Senguttuvan Chera, the most celebrated Chera king, is famous for the legends surrounding Kannagi, the heroine of the Tamil epic "Silapathikaram".
en-000002214	The Chera kingdom owed its importance to trade with West Asia, Greece and Rome.
en-000002215	The second dynasty, Kulasekharas ruled from a city on the banks of River Periyar called Mahodayapuram (Kodungallur).
en-000002216	The Chera rulers of Venad, based at the port Quilon in southern Kerala, trace their relations back to the later/second Cheras.
en-000002217	The word "Chera" probably derived from "Cheral", meaning "declivity of a mountain" in ancient Tamil.
en-000002218	The Cheras are referred as "Kedalaputho" ("Kerala Putra") in the Ashoka's edicts (3rd century BCE).
en-000002219	The Graeco-Roman trade map "Periplus Maris Erythraei" refers the Cheras as "Celobotra".
en-000002220	"Pathirruppaththu ", the fourth book in the"Ettuthokai" anthology of Sangam poems, mentions a number of rulers of the Chera dynasty.
en-000002221	Each ruler is praised in ten songs sung by the court poet.
en-000002222	The rulers (many were heirs-apparent) are mentioned in the following order:
en-000002223	Sangam literature is rich in descriptions about a number of Chera kings and princes, along with the poets who extolled them.
en-000002224	However, these are not worked into connected history and settled chronology so far.
en-000002225	A chronological device, known as Gajabahu synchronism, is used by historians to help date early Tamil history.
en-000002226	Two identical inscriptions near Tiruchirappalli, dated to the 2nd century CE, describe three generations of Chera rulers of the Irumporai clan.
en-000002227	The first of the known rulers of the Chera entity was "Vanavaramban" Perumchottu Uthiyan Cheralathan.
en-000002228	Uthiyan Cheralathan was a contemporary of the Chola ruler Karikala Chola.
en-000002229	Mamulanar credits him with having conducted a feast in honour of his ancestors.
en-000002230	In a battle at Venni, Uthiyan Cheralathan was wounded on the back by Karikala Chola ("Pattinappalai").
en-000002231	Unable to bear the disgrace, the Chera committed suicide by starvation.
en-000002232	Nedum Cheralathan probably consolidated the Chera kingdom, and literature and art developed highly during his period.
en-000002233	Nedum Cheralathan is praised in the Second Ten of Pathirruppaththu composed by his court poet Kannanar.
en-000002234	Nedum Cheralathan, famous for his hospitality, even gave a part of Umbarkkattu (Anamalai) to Kannanar.
en-000002235	He also won another victory over the Yavanas (Westerners) on the coast.
en-000002236	Mamulanar refers to a sea coast township called Mantai and the exhibition ornaments and diamonds captured by Nedum Cheralathan there.

en-000002341	The royal palace was at Gotramalleswaram, now known as Cheraman Parambu.
en-000002342	The city administration was controlled by a special representative body, the "Kuttam".
en-000002343	Mahodaya Puram was also called Vanchi by the later Chera rulers after their former capital.
en-000002344	Chera ruler Kulashekhara Varman (9th century) styles himself in his works as the "Lord of Mahodayapuram".
en-000002345	The famous Jewish Copper Plate grant (1000 CE) was issued by Muyirikkode (Mahodayapuram).
en-000002346	Mahodayapuram was famous throughout South India in the 9th and 10th centuries as great centre of learning and science.
en-000002347	A well-equipped observatory functioned there under the charge of Sankaranarayana (c. 840– c. 900), the Chera court astronomer.
en-000002348	It functioned in accordance with the rules of astronomy laid down by Aryabhata.
en-000002349	and hence it came to be called "Ravi Varma Yantra Valayam".

en-000002351	The Cholas attacked the capital from the north and ravaged the city.
en-000002352	Chola records suggests the fall of the fort at Udagai (Makotai, Mahodayapuram) sometime before 1008 CE.
en-000002353	Other records suggests the Chola ruler's long journey through forests for burning down Udagai.
en-000002354	The number of Chera generals and chieftains were also killed in the battle.
en-000002355	After the end of the Chera state, Mahodayapuram fell into the hands of the Kingdom of Perumpadappu.

en-000002359	In response, some proponents of meat-eating have adduced various scientific, nutritional, cultural, and religious arguments in support of the practice.
en-000002360	In "Animal Liberation", Singer argued that, because non-human animals feel, they should be treated according to utilitarian ethics.
en-000002361	Reducing the worldwide massive food waste would also contribute to reduce meat waste and therefore save animals.
en-000002362	Some have described unequal treatment of humans and animals as a form of speciesism such as anthropocentrism or human-centeredness.
en-000002363	By analogy with racism and sexism, Melanie Joy has dubbed meat-eating "carnism".
en-000002364	The specific circumstances he mentions include using animals to cycle nutrients and convert sun to food.
en-000002365	Ethicists like Tom Regan and Peter Singer define "ethical" in terms of suffering rather than ecology.
en-000002366	They are much more sensitive and intelligent than we ever imagined."
en-000002367	A related argument revolves around non-human organisms'ability to feel pain.
en-000002368	One such reaction is transmarginal inhibition, a phenomenon observed in humans and some animals akin to mental breakdown.
en-000002369	As noted by John Webster (emeritus professor of animal husbandry at the University of Bristol):
en-000002370	This is especially evident when people expect to eat meat in the near future.
en-000002371	Such denial makes it less uncomfortable for people to eat animals.
en-000002372	Ethical vegetarians argue that it is behaviour rather than supporting beliefs that should be adjusted.
en-000002373	Some people choose to be vegetarian or vegan for environmental reasons.
en-000002374	It accounts also for over 8% of global human water use.
en-000002375	Livestock production is by far the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface.
en-000002376	This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products.
en-000002377	The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity.
en-000002378	Indeed, the idea that greenhouse-gas emissions should be reduced to zero by 2050 is gaining wider acceptance.
en-000002379	Other concerns include the wasting of natural resources, such as food and water.
en-000002380	Animals that feed on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops.
en-000002381	Produce 1 kg of meat requires up to 15,000 liters of water.
en-000002382	There are also environmentalist arguments in favor of the morality of eating meat.
en-000002383	One such line of argument holds that sentience and individual welfare are less important to morality than the greater ecological good.
en-000002384	The actual practices of Hindus and Buddhists vary according to their community and according to regional traditions.
en-000002385	Islamic Law and Judaism have dietary guidelines called Halal and Kashrut, respectively.
en-000002386	Causing unnecessary pain to animals is prohibited by the principle of tza'ar ba'alei chayim.
en-000002387	Thus, some opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that the analogy between killing animals and killing people is misleading.
en-000002388	Humans are capable of culture, innovation, and the sublimation of instinct in order to act in an ethical manner.
en-000002389	Animals are not, and so are unequal to humans on a moral level.
en-000002390	The response of ethical vegetarians is that humans have a choice, whereas animals do not.
en-000002391	One study found that approximately 60% of contemporary professional ethicists consider it "morally bad" to eat meat from mammals.
en-000002392	Various programs operate in the US that promote the notion that animals raised for food can be treated humanely.
en-000002393	Some spokespeople for the factory farming industry argue that the animals are better off in total confinement.
en-000002394	For example, according to F J "Sonny" Faison, president of Carroll's Foods:
en-000002395	In response, animal welfare advocates ask for evidence that any factory-bred animal is better off caged than free.
en-000002396	Farm Sanctuary argue that commodifying and slaughtering animals is incompatible with the definition of "humane".
en-000002397	Peter Singer has pointed out that the ethical argument for vegetarianism may not apply to all non-vegetarian food.
en-000002398	No living organism can be described as "wanting" to die for another organism's sustenance.
en-000002399	In an article written for "The New York Times", Carol Kaesuk Yoon argues that:
en-000002400	Matheny says that, when the numbers are adjusted, Davis'argument shows veganism as perpetrating the least harm.
en-000002401	Ethical vegans do not consume dairy or eggs because they believe their production causes animal suffering and/or premature death.
en-000002402	Animal welfare advocates point out that this breaks the natural bond between the mother and her calf.
en-000002403	Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for veal production.
en-000002404	To prolong lactation, dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through artificial insemination.
en-000002405	The closed city of Sverdlovsk had been a major production center of the Soviet military-industrial complex since World War II.
en-000002406	The strain of anthrax produced in "Military Compound 19" near Sverdlovsk was the most powerful in the Soviet arsenal ("Anthrax 836").
en-000002407	It had been isolated as a result of another anthrax leak accident that happened in 1953 in the city of Kirov.
en-000002408	A leak from a bacteriological facility contaminated the city sewer system.
en-000002409	In 1956, biologist Vladimir Sizov found a more virulent strain in rodents captured in this area.
en-000002410	In the late 1980’s, biologists found strains that were resistant to all known insecticides.
en-000002411	The produced anthrax culture had to be dried to produce a fine powder for use as an aerosol.
en-000002412	Large filters over the exhaust pipes were the only barriers between the anthrax dust and the outside environment.
en-000002413	On the last Friday of March 1979, a technician removed a clogged filter while drying machines were temporarily turned off.
en-000002414	The supervisor of the next shift did not find anything unusual in the logbook and turned the machines on.
en-000002415	In a few hours, someone found that the filter was missing and reinstalled it.
en-000002416	The incident was reported to military command, but local and city officials were not immediately informed.
en-000002417	Boris Yeltsin, a local Communist Party official at this time, helped cover up the accident.
en-000002418	All workers of a ceramic plant across the street fell ill during the next few days.
en-000002419	In the 1980s, there was vigorous international debate and speculation as to whether the outbreak was natural or an accidental exposure.
en-000002420	If accidental, there was discussion of whether it represented violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.
en-000002421	Russian Prime Minister Egor Gaidar issued a decree to begin demilitarization of Compound 19 in 1992.
en-000002422	Classified activities were moved underground, and several new laboratories have been constructed and equipped to work with highly dangerous pathogens.
en-000002423	One of their current subjects is reportedly "Bacillus anthracis" strain H-4.
en-000002424	Its virulence and antibiotic resistance have been dramatically increased using genetic engineering.
en-000002425	He was educated at Eton, McGill University (BA) and Harvard Business School (MBA).
en-000002426	Norman represents the fourth generation of the Norman family City dynasty.

en-000002428	Both Ronald Collet Norman and Mark Norman became successful administrators with the National Trust.
en-000002429	In this interpretation of recurrence, as opposed perhaps to the Nietzschean interpretation, there is no metaphysics.
en-000002430	Recurrences take place due to ascertainable circumstances and chains of causality.
en-000002431	If history has lessons to impart, they are to be found "par excellence" in such recurring patterns.
en-000002432	Historic recurrences can sometimes induce a sense of "convergence,""resonance " or"déjà vu".
en-000002433	I had a sense of déjà vu when I saw the photos that emerged in 2004 from Abu Ghraib prison.

en-000002435	He also notes "[t]he view proceeding from a belief in"the uniformity of human nature" [Trompf's emphasis].
en-000002436	It holds that because human nature does not change, the same sort of events can recur at any time."
en-000002437	By the late 5th century, Zosimus (also called "Zosimus the Historian"; fl.
en-000002438	In Rome's decay, Zosimus saw history repeating itself in its general movements.
en-000002439	This metaphor was offered, in varying iterations, by Cicero (106–43 BCE), Seneca (ca.
en-000002440	This social-organism metaphor would recur centuries later in the works of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) and Herbert Spencer (1820–1903).
en-000002441	In turn, from "rovina" springs order, from order "virtù", and from this, glory and good fortune.
en-000002442	The Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana observed that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."

en-000002444	Trompf involves "the isolation of any two specific events which bear a very"striking similarity "".
en-000002445	British novelist Martin Amis observes that recurring patterns of imperial ascendance-and-decline simultaneously are mirrored in, and inform, the novel:
en-000002446	Black citizens faced legal and economic disparities, and violent retribution when they attempted to draw attention to their problems.
en-000002447	Martin Luther King called it the most segregated city in the country.
en-000002448	When local business and governmental leaders resisted the boycott, SCLC agreed to assist.

en-000002450	Birmingham, Alabama was, in 1963, "probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States."
en-000002451	When layoffs were necessary, black employees were often the first to go.
en-000002452	The unemployment rate for blacks was two and a half times higher than for whites.
en-000002453	Its unemployment rate, at just below 5%, is half the European average.
en-000002454	The average income for blacks in the city was less than half that of whites.
en-000002455	Significantly lower pay scales for black workers at the local steel mills were common.
en-000002456	Only 10 percent of the city's black population was registered to vote in 1960.
en-000002457	In addition, Birmingham's economy was stagnating as the city was shifting from blue collar to white collar jobs.
en-000002458	Fifty unsolved racially motivated bombings between 1945 and 1962 had earned the city the nickname "Bombingham".
en-000002459	A neighborhood shared by white and black families experienced so many attacks that it was called "Dynamite Hill".
en-000002460	Black churches in which civil rights were discussed became specific targets for attack.

en-000002465	Described by historian Henry Hampton as a "morass", the Albany movement lost momentum and stalled.
en-000002466	King's reputation had been hurt by the Albany campaign, and he was eager to improve it.
en-000002467	Determined not to make the same mistakes in Birmingham, King and the SCLC changed several of their strategies.
en-000002468	In Albany, they concentrated on the desegregation of the city as a whole.
en-000002469	In Birmingham, their campaign tactics focused on more narrowly defined goals for the downtown shopping and government district.
en-000002470	Birmingham's government was set up in such a way that it gave Connor powerful influence.
en-000002471	In 1961, Connor delayed sending police to intervene when Freedom Riders were beaten by local mobs.
en-000002472	The Birmingham Fire Department interrupted such meetings to search for "phantom fire hazards".
en-000002473	Connor was so antagonistic towards the Civil Rights Movement that his actions galvanized support for black Americans.
en-000002474	President John F. Kennedy later said of him,"The Civil Rights movement should thank God for Bull Connor.
en-000002475	Turmoil in the mayor's office also weakened the Birmingham city government in its opposition to the campaign.
en-000002476	In November 1962, Connor lost the race for mayor to Albert Boutwell, a less combative segregationist.
en-000002477	However, Connor and his colleagues on the City Commission refused to accept the new mayor's authority.
en-000002478	They claimed on a technicality that their terms would not expire until 1965 instead of in the spring of 1963.
en-000002479	So for a brief time, Birmingham had two city governments attempting to conduct business.
en-000002480	The result, however, was a black community more motivated to resist.
en-000002481	In the spring of 1963, before Easter, the Birmingham boycott intensified during the second-busiest shopping season of the year.
en-000002482	Pastors urged their congregations to avoid shopping in Birmingham stores in the downtown district.
en-000002483	If black shoppers were found in these stores, organizers confronted them and shamed them into participating in the boycott.
en-000002484	Campaign participant Joe Dickson recalled,"We had to go under strict surveillance.
en-000002485	Martin Luther King's presence in Birmingham was not welcomed by all in the black community.
en-000002486	A white Jesuit priest assisting in desegregation negotiations attested the "demonstrations [were] poorly timed and misdirected".
en-000002487	He headed the planning of what he called Project C, which stood for "confrontation".
en-000002488	The plan called for direct nonviolent action to attract media attention to "the biggest and baddest city of the South".
en-000002489	Some white spectators at a sit-in at a Woolworth's lunch counter spat upon the participants.
en-000002490	A few hundred protesters, including jazz musician Al Hibbler, were arrested, although Hibbler was immediately released by Connor.
en-000002491	The SCLC's goals were to fill the jails with protesters to force the city government to negotiate as demonstrations continued.
en-000002492	Fred Shuttlesworth called the injunction a "flagrant denial of our constitutional rights" and organizers prepared to defy the order.
en-000002493	The decision to ignore the injunction had been made during the planning stage of the campaign.
en-000002494	Incoming mayor Albert Boutwell called King and the SCLC organizers "strangers" whose only purpose in Birmingham was "to stir inter-racial discord".
en-000002495	The movement organizers found themselves out of money after the amount of required bail was raised.
en-000002496	Because King was the major fundraiser, his associates urged him to travel the country to raise bail money for those arrested.
en-000002497	He had, however, previously promised to lead the marchers to jail in solidarity, but hesitated as the planned date arrived.
en-000002498	"I have never seen Martin so troubled", one of King's friends later said.
en-000002499	Bobby Kennedy is looking here at Birmingham, the United States Congress is looking at Birmingham.
en-000002500	King's supporters sent telegrams about his arrest to the White House.
en-000002501	Twenty-four hours after his arrest, King was allowed to see local attorneys from the SCLC.
en-000002502	The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon.
en-000002503	When Martin Luther King called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped.
en-000002504	Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.
en-000002505	Bass suggested that "Letter from Birmingham Jail" was pre-planned, as was every move King and his associates made in Birmingham.
en-000002506	The essay was a culmination of many of King's ideas, which he had touched on in earlier writings.
en-000002507	King's arrest attracted national attention, including that of corporate officers of retail chains with stores in downtown Birmingham.
en-000002508	Despite the publicity surrounding King's arrest, the campaign was faltering because few demonstrators were willing to risk arrest.
en-000002509	After initiating the idea he organized and educated the students in nonviolence tactics and philosophy.
en-000002510	He also saw that adults in the black community were divided about how much support to give the protests.
en-000002511	He recruited girls who were school leaders and boys who were athletes.
en-000002512	Bevel found girls more receptive to his ideas because they had less experience as victims of white violence.
en-000002513	Bevel and the SCLC held workshops to help students overcome their fear of dogs and jails.
en-000002514	They showed films of the Nashville sit-ins organized in 1960 to end segregation at public lunch counters.
en-000002515	On May 2, more than a thousand students skipped school and gathered at the 16th Street Baptist Church.
en-000002516	Demonstrators were given instructions to march to the downtown area, to meet with the Mayor, and integrate the chosen buildings.
en-000002517	They were to leave in smaller groups and continue on their courses until arrested.
en-000002518	More than 600 students were arrested; the youngest of these was reported to be eight years old.
en-000002519	Children left the churches while singing hymns and "freedom songs" such as "We Shall Overcome".
en-000002520	They clapped and laughed while being arrested and awaiting transport to jail.
en-000002521	They assembled paddy wagons and school buses to take the children to jail.
en-000002522	The day's arrests brought the total number of jailed protesters to 1,200 in the 900-capacity Birmingham jail.
en-000002523	Incoming mayor Albert Boutwell and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy condemned the decision to use children in the protests.
en-000002524	Malcolm X criticized the decision, saying, "Real men don't put their children on the firing line."
en-000002525	That evening he declared at a mass meeting,"I have been inspired and moved by today.
en-000002526	The D Day campaign received front page coverage by "The Washington Post" and "The New York Times".
en-000002527	As the demonstrators left the church, police warned them to stop and turn back, "or you'll get wet".
en-000002528	Boys'shirts were ripped off, and young women were pushed over the tops of cars by the force of the water.
en-000002529	When the students crouched or fell, the blasts of water rolled them down the asphalt streets and concrete sidewalks.
en-000002530	Connor allowed white spectators to push forward, shouting,"Let those people come forward, sergeant.
en-000002531	My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom.
en-000002532	I have to go help them", and hung up the phone.
en-000002533	To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line.
en-000002534	That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand,"Don't worry about your children who are in jail.
en-000002535	Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police.
en-000002536	The first photo Moore shot that day showed three teenagers being hit by a water jet from a high-pressure firehose.
en-000002537	It was titled "They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out".
en-000002538	A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography.
en-000002539	Moore suspected that the film he shot "was likely to obliterate in the national psyche any notion of a'good southerner'."
en-000002540	Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and police dogs attacking unprotected demonstrators.
en-000002541	President Kennedy told a group of people at the White House that "The New York Times" photo made him "sick".
en-000002542	A "New York Times" editorial called the behavior of the Birmingham police "a national disgrace."
en-000002543	President Kennedy sent Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall to Birmingham to help negotiate a truce.
en-000002544	Marshall faced a stalemate when merchants and protest organizers refused to budge.
en-000002545	Black onlookers in the area of Kelly Ingram Park abandoned nonviolence on May 5.
en-000002546	Spectators taunted police, and SCLC leaders begged them to be peaceful or go home.
en-000002547	James Bevel borrowed a bullhorn from the police and shouted,"Everybody get off this corner.
en-000002548	If you're not going to demonstrate in a nonviolent way, then leave!"
en-000002549	Commissioner Connor was overheard saying, "If you'd ask half of them what freedom means, they couldn't tell you."
en-000002550	To prevent further marches, Connor ordered the doors to the churches blocked to prevent students from leaving.
en-000002551	Singer Joan Baez arrived to perform for free at Miles College and stayed at the black-owned and integrated Gaston Motel.
en-000002552	Comedian Dick Gregory and Barbara Deming, a writer for "The Nation", were both arrested.
en-000002553	The car of Fannie Flagg, a local television personality and recent Miss Alabama finalist, was surrounded by teenagers who recognized her.
en-000002554	She rolled down the window and shouted to the children, "I'm with you all the way!"
en-000002555	White business leaders met with protest organizers to try arrange an economic solution but said they had no control over politics.
en-000002556	Protest organizers disagreed, saying that business leaders were positioned to pressure political leaders.
en-000002557	Breakfast in the jail took four hours to distribute to all the prisoners.
en-000002558	Seventy members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce pleaded with the protest organizers to stop the actions.
en-000002559	The NAACP asked for sympathizers to picket in unity in 100 American cities.
en-000002560	Nineteen rabbis from New York flew to Birmingham, equating silence about segregation to the atrocities of the Holocaust.
en-000002561	The editor of "The Birmingham News" wired President Kennedy and pleaded with him to end the protests.
en-000002562	Fire hoses were used once again, injuring police and Fred Shuttlesworth, as well as other demonstrators.
en-000002563	Commissioner Connor expressed regret at missing seeing Shuttlesworth get hit and said he "wished they'd carried him away in a hearse".
en-000002564	News of the mass arrests of children had reached Western Europe and the Soviet Union.
en-000002565	Soviet news commentary accused the Kennedy administration of neglect and "inactivity".
en-000002566	Organizers planned to flood the downtown area businesses with black people.
en-000002567	Smaller groups of decoys were set out to distract police attention from activities at the 16th Street Baptist Church.
en-000002568	Protesters set off false fire alarms to occupy the fire department and its hoses.
en-000002569	One group of children approached a police officer and announced, "We want to go to jail!"
en-000002570	When the officer pointed the way, the students ran across Kelly Ingram Park shouting, "We're going to jail!"
en-000002571	Large groups of protesters sat in stores and sang freedom songs.
en-000002572	Streets, sidewalks, stores, and buildings were overwhelmed with more than 3,000 protesters.
en-000002573	On May 8 at 4 a.m., white business leaders agreed to most of the protesters'demands.
en-000002574	Those in jail would be released on bond or their own recognizance.
en-000002575	When police went to inspect the motel, they were met with rocks and bottles from neighborhood blacks.
en-000002576	Upon picking up his last paycheck, Bull Connor remarked tearfully, "This is the worst day of my life."
en-000002577	In June 1963, the Jim Crow signs regulating segregated public places in Birmingham were taken down.
en-000002578	In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement.
en-000002579	Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15.
en-000002580	Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient.
en-000002581	By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned.
en-000002582	Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules.
en-000002583	City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens.
en-000002584	The campaign brought national and international attention to racist violence in Birmingham.
en-000002585	Fear that unrest might spread provoked a meeting of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy with James Baldwin and other Black leaders.
en-000002586	The reputation of Martin Luther King soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero.
en-000002587	The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities.
en-000002588	King became "Time"'s Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.
en-000002589	The Civil Rights Act applied to the entire nation, prohibiting racial discrimination in employment and in access to public places.
en-000002590	Roy Wilkins of the NAACP, however, disagreed that the Birmingham campaign was the primary force behind the Civil Rights Act.
en-000002591	The Birmingham campaign inspired the Civil Rights Movement in other parts of the South.
en-000002592	On June 12, 1963, Evers was fatally shot outside his home.
en-000002593	He had been organizing demonstrations similar to those in Birmingham to pressure Jackson's city government.
en-000002594	The black middle class generally assumed leadership in Birmingham and the SCLC, and the black underclass still struggled.
en-000002595	A study of the Watts riots concluded, "The'rules of the game'in race relations were permanently changed in Birmingham."
en-000002596	Wyatt Tee Walker wrote that the Birmingham campaign was "legend" and had become the Civil Rights Movement's most important chapter.
en-000002597	It was"the chief watershed of the nonviolent movement in the United States.
en-000002598	Walker called the Birmingham campaign and the Selma marches "Siamese twins" joining to "kill segregation ... and bury the body".
en-000002599	The character first appeared in "DC Comics Presents"#87 (November 1985), and was created by Elliot S!
en-000002600	Maggin and Curt Swan (based upon the original Superboy character by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster).
en-000002601	Superboy-Prime is from a parallel Earth called Earth-Prime that had no super-heroes.
en-000002602	There, Superman and the other comic superheroes were fictional characters only seen in comic books.
en-000002603	Prime firmly believes that becoming Superman is his calling despite the fact that he has become a psychotic and murderous villain.
en-000002604	His overwhelming strength, speed, and ruthlessness make him one of the most dangerous foes in the DC Universe.
en-000002605	Earth-Prime's Superboy first refers to himself as "Superboy-Prime" in "Infinite Crisis"#2 (January 2006).
en-000002606	Superboy-Prime is from the universe known as Earth Prime, in which the DC heroes are fictional comic book characters.
en-000002607	Young Clark lives the first fifteen years of his life as a normal boy.
en-000002608	At the same time, the Earth-One Superman finds his way to Earth Prime and the two Supermen meet.
en-000002609	Superboy-Prime is drawn into the "Crisis on Infinite Earths" after his universe is consumed in the light of the Anti-Monitor.
en-000002610	In the "paradise dimension", Superboy-Prime secludes himself from the others, using crystals to replay events from his life on Earth Prime.
en-000002611	Superboy-Prime becomes frustrated and angry, and he tries to reach out to Kal-L, whose attention is focused on Lois's failing health.
en-000002612	Superboy-Prime hesitates until he overhears Kal-L say:"I wish this world would let him grow up.
en-000002613	Finally, Alexander shows him the deaths of his parents and girlfriend in a car accident on the post- "Crisis" Earth.
en-000002614	This assault caused ripples that altered reality, which was used as an explanation for character changes and retcons in DC continuity.
en-000002615	Eventually, Alexander reveals to Superboy-Prime that his powers are returning, and the two combine forces to break through the barrier wall.
en-000002616	Together, they set into motion the events that culminate in "Infinite Crisis":
en-000002617	When introduced to Power Girl, he calls himself Superboy-Prime for the first time.
en-000002618	Kal-L tells Power Girl:"When the universe was reborn, Earth-One became the primary world.
en-000002619	Superboy-Prime confronts Superboy, telling him that he (Superboy-Prime) is the only Superboy the Earth needs.
en-000002620	Superboy-Prime brutally attacks Conner, but not before Connor activates his Titans homing signal.
en-000002621	The Teen Titans, the Doom Patrol, and the Justice Society of America arrive to help Conner.
en-000002622	During the battle, Black Adam discovers that his magic has little effect against Superboy-Prime.
en-000002623	After Superboy-Prime attempts to kill Wonder Girl, an enraged Conner Kent attacks him.
en-000002624	Conner dies from injuries sustained during the explosion, leaving the rest of the superheroes devastated.
en-000002625	Alexander and Superboy-Prime join the Battle of Metropolis and quarrel about their contingency plan.
en-000002626	Upon hearing of the new plan, Superboy-Prime refuses to help Alex, as he believes New Earth to be hopelessly inferior.
en-000002627	When Batman, Wonder Woman, Kal-El, and Kal-L arrive to save Metropolis, Kal-L confronts Alex about his role in the destruction.
en-000002628	Meanwhile, Superboy-Prime is attacked by Bart Allen, who has been left outraged by Conner's death.
en-000002629	Although the majority of the Earth's heroes are in pursuit, Superboy-Prime eludes capture.
en-000002630	Superboy-Prime is slowed down by a 300-mile thick wall of pure willpower generated by the Green Lantern Corps.
en-000002631	The two Supermen arrive and fly Superboy-Prime through Rao, the red sun of Krypton.
en-000002632	The heat melts away Superboy-Prime's armor, and severely weakens all three Kryptonians, who then crash on Mogo.
en-000002633	Superboy-Prime beats Kal-L to death, but is then attacked by Kal-El.
en-000002634	Superboy-Prime claims that he is better than Kal-El, and that his Krypton was superior to Kal-El's.
en-000002635	Although nearly powerless, Kal-El knocks Superboy-Prime out before collapsing himself, but members of the Green Lantern Corps manage to save Kal-El.
en-000002636	While inside his cell, he carves the Superman symbol into his chest.
en-000002637	When the Sinestro Corps attack Oa, Superboy-Prime is released from his imprisonment and joins them.
en-000002638	Superman, Power Girl, and Supergirl arrive and stop him, only to have him escape as the sun rises, restoring his powers.
en-000002639	Afterwards, Superman-Prime brutally battles Ion (Sodam Yat) throughout the state of New York.
en-000002640	Superman-Prime gets the upper hand over Yat by exposing him to lead, and defeats him.
en-000002641	However, instead of dying, Prime is infused with Oan energy and warped back into the multiverse.
en-000002642	He arrives on Earth-15 and attacks that world's Lex Luthor, blaming him for Alexander Luthor's failure to make the universe "perfect".
en-000002643	Mxyzptlk escapes with the help of another prisoner, Annataz Arataz, an alternate version of Zatanna from Earth-3.
en-000002644	Annataz is killed when Superman-Prime grows angry and gives up on using magic to achieve his goals.
en-000002645	He appears on the Monitors'satellite headquarters and threatens Solomon to help him find Earth Prime.
en-000002646	Solomon tells him that if he releases Forerunner, he will show him what he wants; he does so.
en-000002647	He encounters the elderly couple who own the farm, and they refer to him as "Superboy", which enrages him.
en-000002648	This sends him into a tantrum, in which he wrecks the museum and kills security guards and police officers.
en-000002649	He learns that the evil Legion followed a code of evil, inspired by a dark being whose "name was never spoken".
en-000002650	Unlike most denizens of the 31st century, they all recognize Prime and seem overjoyed to see him.
en-000002651	The dialogue seems to imply that Prime was the dark being whose example the villains follow.
en-000002652	Learning of the prison break, the Legion of Super-Heroes call Superman from the 21st Century.
en-000002653	During the fight, the Trapper is revealed to be an aged Superboy-Prime.
en-000002654	Back on Earth, Conner quickly begins gaining the upper-hand against Prime.
en-000002655	If Europe were only about gaining the upper hand, it would generate perpetual conflict.
en-000002656	Using his heat-vision, Conner manages to create a deep wound across the S-shield that Prime had carved into his chest.
en-000002657	Meanwhile at the end of time, the same wound appears on Time Trapper's chest.
en-000002658	Superman and the three Legion founders transport him to the 31st Century, where the Trapper faces his younger self.
en-000002659	Superboy-Prime and Trapper start bickering which culminates with their mutual destruction after Prime attacks Time Trapper, creating a paradox.
en-000002660	The paradox created by Prime attacking himself returns him to Earth-Prime.
en-000002661	Prime lives in his parents'basement, who support him out of fear for what he might do to them.
en-000002662	Despite the physical depletion of his powers, his eyes begin glowing red again.
en-000002663	Upon calling forth Superboy's victims, he teasingly reveals to him his impending death in "Adventure Comics"#5.
en-000002664	Before he can do so, Alexander teleports him to his basement, and begins destroying his comic collection.
en-000002665	Superboy-Prime then accepts the hopelessness of his situation, and willingly puts on a black ring, which wills him to "die".
en-000002666	As they embrace, a Black Lantern ring is shown on Laurie's hand that detects the hope within Prime's heart.
en-000002667	Enraged by his separation from Laurie, Superboy-Prime vows to destroy the Teen Titans and find a possible way to return home.
en-000002668	Superboy-Prime and his team attempt to destroy Titans Tower, but are met by the large group of former Teen Titans.
en-000002669	Although he claims to have made it himself, Bart Allen remembers him stealing it following his escape.
en-000002670	It is destroyed when the two Supermen fly Superboy-Prime through Krypton's red sun.
en-000002671	In "", Superboy-Prime dons his original armor once more, taking it from a statue in the Superman museum.
en-000002672	During the Blackest Night, the Black Lantern Alexander Luthor provides Superboy-Prime with a copy of his original armor.
en-000002673	Whereas most versions of Superman have a weakness to magic, Superboy-Prime does not.
en-000002674	Additionally, most versions are affected by kryptonite; however, kryptonite from one universe does not affect Kryptonians from other universes.
en-000002675	It is revealed that threeboot Element Lad is from Earth-Prime's future.
en-000002676	Superboy-Prime loses his powers when exposed to a red sun, as do other versions of Superman.
en-000002677	In his first appearance, he is shown to resist the effects of red sun radiation; however, this radiation was artificial.
en-000002678	Every time Prime has been depowered it has taken an actual red sun, and not merely localized red sun radiation.
en-000002679	Afterward, the Green Lantern Corps imprison him inside a "junior" Red Sun-Eater, which similarly depowers him.
en-000002680	His reaction to psionics has not been fully explored, although Martian Manhunter is shown to be able to read his mind.
en-000002681	Saturn Girl's attempts to attack him psionically seem to have little effect.
en-000002682	Upon realizing he is too late, Prime even screams in fear upon seeing the returned Kid Flash racing towards him.
en-000002683	Massive amounts of quantum energy have been shown to injure Superboy-Prime as well, as seen in his battle with Monarch.
en-000002684	He was Superboy a little bit before "Crisis on Infinite Earths" and then—BOOM!—his world was wiped out and that was it".
en-000002685	"I said to Dan I think Prime does it by accident and is horrified.
en-000002686	Superboy-Prime is a very simplistic character who has become very complex".
en-000002687	When asked if Superboy-Prime was irredeemable or not, Johns replied"I think it's a split.
en-000002688	Is it the fact that, now that he's got a big dent on his car, another one won't matter?
en-000002689	Developed and published by Enlight Software for Microsoft Windows, the player designs, owns and operates a restaurant.
en-000002690	The player has to keep guests happy and make money at the same time.
en-000002691	There are no confines as there are in the storyline mode (regular mode) but there are no challenges either.
en-000002692	In the game, a global culinary conglomerate, Omnifood, controls over 60% of the world's restaurants and is rapidly growing.
en-000002693	Given the rapidly growing need for global cooperation, the UN simply cannot get by on its current budget.

en-000002721	The meadow also houses Victoria Memorial, Eden Gardens, and several other sports clubs.
en-000002722	The residential buildings are mainly lowrise and are older colonial buildings and numerous new four storey apartment blocks.
en-000002723	Ten to twelve storey apartment blocks have come up in large numbers in south Kolkata.
en-000002724	The city has relaxed its rules on highrise construction recently and twenty storey buildings are becoming more common.
en-000002725	Huge construction activity along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass is changing the face of the city.
en-000002726	Luxury hotels, convention centres, speciality hospitals, condominium complexes, malls and multiplexes are coming up at a rapid pace.

en-000002734	Catholic Christianity is the dominant religion in Mexico, representing about 82.7% of the total population as of 2010.
en-000002735	Mexico is a secular country and has allowed freedom of religion since the mid-19th century.
en-000002736	Traditional Protestant denominations and the open practice of Judaism established themselves in the country during that era.
en-000002737	Modern growth has been seen in Evangelical Protestantism, Mormonism and in folk religions, such as "Mexicayotl".
en-000002738	Buddhism and Islam have both made limited inroads through immigration and conversion.
en-000002739	The government does not provide financial contributions to the religious institutions, nor does the Roman Catholic Church participate in public education.
en-000002740	Economies in which government provides these public goods perform far better than those in which it does not.
en-000002741	Until recently, priests did not have the right to vote, and even now they cannot be elected to public office.
en-000002742	Historically the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico is the oldest established church, established in the early sixteenth century.
en-000002743	At independence, the Roman Catholic Church kept its status as the only permissible church in Mexico.
en-000002744	Other Christian denominations have grown in Mexico, dating from the twentieth century.
en-000002745	With the growth of immigration from the Middle East, Eastern Catholic churches were established.
en-000002746	Roman Catholics are 82.7% of the total population, down from 96% in 1970.
en-000002747	In absolute terms, Mexico has the world's second largest number of Catholics, surpassed only by Brazil.
en-000002748	Mexicans are at least nominally Catholic, some combine or syncretize Catholic practices with native traditions.
en-000002749	The Anglican Communion is represented by the Anglican Church of Mexico.
en-000002750	It is also sizable in the Mexican states that border the U.S. State of Texas.
en-000002751	Protestantism is also on the rise as it offers a less legalistic and hierarchical version of Christianity.
en-000002752	There are some Mexicans practicing Eastern Orthodoxy in Mexico, mainly foreign-born people.
en-000002753	The 2000 national census counted more than one million Jehovah's Witnesses.
en-000002754	According to the Jehovah's Witnesses official figures for 2014 there were over 800,000 members involved in preaching.
en-000002755	La Luz del Mundo is a Charismatic Christian denomination with international headquarters in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.
en-000002756	The presence of Jews in Mexico dates back to 1521, when Hernán Cortés conquered the Aztecs, accompanied by several Conversos.
en-000002757	The Bahá'í Faith in Mexico begins with visits of Bahá'ís before 1916.
en-000002758	With continued growth the National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1961.
en-000002759	The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated almost 38,000 Bahá'ís in 2005.
en-000002760	It is used by the Dalai Lama and other leaders of Tibetan Buddhism to preserve and share Tibetan culture and spirituality.
en-000002761	Alejandro Jodorowsky has stated that he discovered Zen Buddhism in the 1960s while in Mexico.
en-000002762	There are also two institutions from Theravada Buddhism tradition, the Theravada Buddhist Monastery and the Vipassana House of Meditation.
en-000002763	Thus, the lower emissions that IGCC technology allows through gasification and pre-combustion carbon capture is crucial to addressing aforementioned concerns.
en-000002764	In this example the syngas produced is used as fuel in a gas turbine which produces electrical power.
en-000002765	This steam is then used in steam turbines to produce additional electrical power.
en-000002766	The key disadvantage is the amount of CO2 released without pre-combustion capture.
en-000002767	Pulverized coal plants can only capture carbon dioxide after combustion when it is diluted and harder to separate.
en-000002768	CCS technology captures carbon dioxide at the source of its emission, compresses it, and stores it permanently underground.
en-000002769	In comparison, gasification in IGCC allows for separation and capture of the concentrated and pressurized carbon dioxide before combustion.
en-000002770	Syngas cleanup includes filters to remove bulk particulates, scrubbing to remove fine particulates, and solid absorbents for mercury removal.
en-000002771	Additionally, hydrogen gas is used as fuel, which produces no pollutants under combustion.
en-000002772	Then steam exhaust must then be condensed with cooling water, and water is lost by evaporation.
en-000002773	Steam is only used to capture the heat from the combustion turbine exhaust for use in a secondary steam turbine.
en-000002774	Currently, the major drawback is the high capital cost compared to other forms of power production.
en-000002775	The Wabash River Generating Station is now wholly owned and operated by the Wabash River Power Association.
en-000002776	IGCC is now touted as "capture ready" and could potentially be used to capture and store carbon dioxide.
en-000002777	This installation had been planned, but there has been no information about it since 2009.
en-000002778	There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon capture and various variations
en-000002779	A key issue in implementing IGCC is its high capital cost, which prevents it from competing with other power plant technologies.
en-000002780	Currently, ordinary pulverized coal plants are the lowest cost power plant option.
en-000002781	The advantage of IGCC comes from the ease of retrofitting existing power plants that could offset the high capital cost.
en-000002782	In a 2007 model, IGCC with CCS is the lowest-cost system in all cases.
en-000002783	The potential benefit of retrofitting has so far, not offset the cost of IGCC with carbon capture technology.
en-000002784	Pulverized coal and NGCC costs did not change significantly since 2010.
en-000002785	Recent testimony in regulatory proceedings show the cost of IGCC to be twice that predicted by Goddell, from $96 to 104/MWhr.
en-000002786	Wabash River was down repeatedly for long stretches due to gasifier problems.
en-000002787	The gasifier problems have not been remedied—subsequent projects, such as Excelsior's Mesaba Project, have a third gasifier and train built in.
en-000002788	However, the past year has seen Wabash River running reliably, with availability comparable to or better than other technologies.
en-000002789	Third, unplanned down time on the gasifier because of refractory liner problems, and those problems were expensive to repair.
en-000002790	The gasifier was originally designed in Italy to be half the size of what was built at Polk.
en-000002791	Newer ceramic materials may assist in improving gasifier performance and longevity.
en-000002792	Keim, K., 2009, IGCC A Project on Sustainability Management Systems for Plant Re-Design and Re-Image.
en-000002793	General Electric is currently designing an IGCC model plant that should introduce greater reliability.
en-000002794	Eastman's industrial gasification plant in Kingsport, TN uses a GE Energy solid-fed gasifier.
en-000002795	Eastman, a fortune 500 company, built the facility in 1983 without any state or federal subsidies and turns a profit.
en-000002796	There are several refinery-based IGCC plants in Europe that have demonstrated good availability (90-95%) after initial shakedown periods.
en-000002797	Another IGCC success story has been the 250 MW Buggenum plant in The Netherlands.
en-000002798	This coal-based IGCC plant currently uses about 30% biomass as a supplemental feedstock.
en-000002799	The owner, NUON, is paid an incentive fee by the government to use the biomass.
en-000002800	NUON has constructed a 1,311 MW IGCC plant in the Netherlands, comprising three 437 MW STEG units.
en-000002801	The Nuon Magnum IGCC power plant was commissioned in 2011, and was officially opened in June 2013.
en-000002802	Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has been awarded to construct the power plant.
en-000002803	A new generation of IGCC-based coal-fired power plants has been proposed, although none is yet under construction.
en-000002804	of Commerce analysis found IGCC to have the highest cost, with an emissions profile not significantly better than pulverized coal.
en-000002805	In Delaware, the Delmarva and state consultant analysis had essentially the same results.
en-000002806	The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al.
en-000002807	)[20] also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later.
en-000002808	With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%.
en-000002809	However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium.
en-000002810	IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.
en-000002811	In September 2007, they started up a 250 MW demo plant in Nakoso.
en-000002812	It burns PRB coal with an unburned carbon content ratio of <0.1% and no detected leaching of trace elements.
en-000002813	It employs not only "F" type turbines but "G" type as well.
en-000002814	The main feature is that instead of using oxygen and nitrogen to gasify coal, they use oxygen and CO.
en-000002815	The CO extracted from gas turbine exhaust gas is utilized in this system.
en-000002816	During pre-combustion in IGCC, the partial pressure of CO is nearly 1000 times higher than in post-combustion flue gas.
en-000002817	Physical solvents work by absorbing the acid gases without the need of a chemical reaction as in traditional amine based solvents.
en-000002818	The solvent can then be regenerated, and the CO desorbed, by reducing the pressure.
en-000002819	National and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test IGCC Power Plants.
en-000002820	This honest disclosure has begun to reduce investor interest in all types of existing-technology coal-fired power plant development, including IGCC.
en-000002821	Reid wants Nevada utility companies to invest in solar energy, wind energy and geothermal energy instead of coal technologies.
en-000002822	The long-term healthcare costs would be far too high, he claimed (no source attributed).
en-000002823	"I'm going to do everything I can to stop these plants.
en-000002824	There is cleaner coal technology, but there is no clean coal technology."
en-000002825	In November 1989, the Conseil d'État ruled that the scarf's quasi religious expression was compatible with the "laïcité" of public schools.
en-000002826	This is not possible without allowing some form of religious expression in public life.
en-000002827	In January 1990, three girls were suspended from Louis Pasteur Middle School in Noyon, a city in Picardy.
en-000002828	The parents of one of the girls previously suspended from Gabriel Havez filed a defamation suit against its principal.
en-000002829	Following these events, teachers at a middle school in Nantua held a general strike in protest against the scarf in school.
en-000002830	A second government statement reiterated the need to respect the principle of secularity in public schools.
en-000002831	In November, 24 veiled students were suspended from the same high school as well as from Faidherbe High in Lille.
en-000002832	In nearly half of these cases, their exclusions were annulled by the French courts.
en-000002833	It is not explicitly commanded in the Qur'an yet some consider it a part of tradition.
en-000002834	In most Muslim societies, this obligation is not enforced by law.
en-000002835	In Egypt and Turkey, for example, wearing the scarf is controversially forbidden in certain professional contexts.
en-000002836	It is often speculated that forbidding the hijab would limit freedom.
en-000002837	Certain individuals and associations consider the scarf to be a symbol of belonging to the Muslim community.
en-000002838	The position of the French government is that secularism in schools is incompatible with wearing ostentatious religious articles, whatever they be.
en-000002839	France is home to both the largest Jewish and Muslim minorities in Western Europe.
en-000002840	A strong majority of French educators opposes the veil in general, and particularly in classes.
en-000002841	The arguments put forward are connected to both secularism and feminist arguments, a majority of French educators being women.
en-000002842	Many individuals and organizations have been opposed to the idea of a law forbidding the veil since it was first proposed.
en-000002843	The collective "Les Blédardes" sees the controversy over the veil as a manifestation of colonialist sentiments.
en-000002844	Furthermore, some Islamic feminists have expressed offense at double standards implicit in some (non-Muslim) feminist arguments.
en-000002845	Thus, when some feminists began defending the headscarf on the grounds of "tradition", Fadela Amara countered:"It's not tradition, it's archaic!
en-000002846	When Algerian women fought against wearing the headscarf in Algeria, French feminists supported them.
en-000002847	But when it's some young girl in a French suburb school, they don't.
en-000002848	They define liberty and equality according to what colour your skin is.
en-000002849	Another argument is that making it illegal sends a message that hate crimes may be more tolerable.
en-000002850	The traditional French family would be, on the other hand, exogamous.
en-000002851	This tradition recalls images of Greco-Roman mythology and folk-tales in which a man travels far and wide to find a wife.
en-000002852	In multicultural countries where the veil is more widely accepted (UK, United States), the rate of mixed marriages is far lower.
en-000002853	The law, sometimes referred to as "the veil law", was voted in by the French parliament in March 2004.
en-000002854	It forbids the wearing of any "ostentatious" religious articles, including the Islamic veil, the Jewish kippa, and large Christian crosses.
en-000002855	The law permits discreet signs of faith, such as small crosses, Stars of David, and hands of Fatima.
en-000002856	Former education minister François Fillon has stated that the law does not apply whatsoever to the parents of students.
en-000002857	In May 2005 the mother of a student was denied permission to run a stand at her son's school festival.
en-000002858	Applicable legislation grants them freedom of expression as long as public order is preserved.
en-000002859	In public hospitals, employees are expected to respect the principle of secularism.
en-000002860	As far as patients are concerned, the rule is to respect religious preferences.
en-000002861	Some court decisions have clarified issues remained open by the law, and its legality.
en-000002862	These jurisprudence were issued by the French administrative Supreme Court "Conseil d'Etat" and by the European Court of Human Rights.
en-000002863	Wearing either a Sikh subturban or a bandana were then denied by the supreme court.
en-000002864	On 4 December 2008, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) affirmed the legality of the ban.
en-000002865	Throughout the process legislation banning religious head-scarves in France has been met with widely varied reactions.
en-000002866	The woman was warned about the new dress code on the beach.
en-000002867	In addition, she was fined 38 euro for wearing the swim wear.
en-000002868	Also, four women were fined 38 euros for wearing their burkinis on the beach in Cannes.
en-000002869	The controversy has also, however, brought the issue of the place of Islam in French society to the forefront of debate.
en-000002870	The presence of Muslim Frenchwomen wearing tricolour veils and shouting, "I am French!"
en-000002871	in protests in Paris against the law forbidding the veil is one example thereof.
en-000002872	The figure falls to 68% for respondents who believe in the separation of church and state.
en-000002873	The report cites the files of 806 students affected by the law.
en-000002874	Of the 806 students, 533 have accepted the law and no longer wear their veils in class.
en-000002875	The report also gives an assessment of students who have left the French school system because of this issue.
en-000002876	The number of those who have chosen to study via other, non-government forms of correspondence schools is unknown.
en-000002877	However, the actual number of those who no longer attend French junior high and high schools over their veils is unknown.
en-000002878	The law was constitutionally cleared so that it came into force in April 2011.
en-000002879	New vaccines are being developed by the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, including TBVI and Aeras.
en-000002880	To promote successful and lasting management of the TB epidemic, effective vaccination is required.
en-000002881	However, improved efficacy of multiple dosages has yet to be demonstrated.
en-000002882	Since the BCG vaccine does not offer complete protection against TB, vaccines have been designed to bolster BCG’s effectiveness.
en-000002883	The industry has now transitioned from developing new alternatives, to selecting the best options currently available to advance into clinical testing.
en-000002884	MVA85A is characterized as the“most advanced‘boost'candidate” to date.
en-000002885	To improve efficacy, research approaches have been directed at modifying the delivery method of vaccinations.
en-000002886	This particular combination proved to be protective against mycobacterial invasion in animals, and both modes are well tolerated.
en-000002887	The design incentive behind aerosol delivery is to target the lungs rapidly, easily and painlessly in contrast to intradermal immunization.
en-000002888	In murine studies, intradermal vaccination caused localized inflammation at the site of injection whereas MVA85A did not cause unfavourable effects.
en-000002889	A correlation has been found between the mode of delivery and vaccine protection efficacy.
en-000002890	Research data suggests aerosol delivery has not only physiological and economic advantages, but also the potential to supplement systemic vaccination.
en-000002891	All of this suggests that the economics textbook of 2033 will look very different from the economics textbook of today.
en-000002892	Treatment and prevention of TB has been delayed compared to the resources and research efforts put into other diseases.
en-000002893	Large pharmaceutical companies do not see profitable investment because of TB’s association with the developing world.
en-000002894	Progression of vaccine designs relies heavily on outcomes in animal models.
en-000002895	Appropriate animal models are scarce because it is difficult to imitate TB in non-human species.
en-000002896	It is also challenging finding a species to test on a large-scale.
en-000002897	Most animal testing for TB vaccines has been conducted on murine, bovine and non-primate species.
en-000002898	Recently, a study deemed zebrafish a potentially suitable model organism for preclinical vaccine development.
en-000002899	The Linux kernel is a monolithic Unix-like computer operating system kernel.
en-000002900	The Android operating system for tablet computers, smartphones and smartwatches is also based atop the Linux kernel.
en-000002901	As part of the kernel's functionality, device drivers control the hardware; "mainlined" device drivers are also meant to be very stable.
en-000002902	The Linux kernel, developed by contributors worldwide, is a prominent example of free and open source software.
en-000002903	Day-to-day development discussions take place on the Linux kernel mailing list (LKML).
en-000002904	He started with a task switcher in Intel 80386 assembly language and a terminal driver.
en-000002905	On 25 August 1991, Torvalds posted the following to "comp.os.minix", a newsgroup on Usenet:
en-000002906	Early on, the MINIX community contributed code and ideas to the Linux kernel.
en-000002907	The BSD operating system had not yet freed itself from legal encumbrances.
en-000002908	Despite the limited functionality of the early versions, Linux rapidly accumulated developers and users.
en-000002909	In October 1991, version 0.02 of the Linux kernel was released.
en-000002910	A newsgroup known as "alt.os.linux" was started, and on 19 January 1992, the first post to alt.os.linux was made.
en-000002911	In March 1992, Linux version 0.95 was the first to be capable of running X.
en-000002912	However, this proved to be somewhat overoptimistic, and from 1993 to early 1994, 15 development versions of version 0.99 appeared.
en-000002913	On 14 March 1994, Linux kernel 1.0.0 was released, with 176,250 lines of code.
en-000002914	In March 1995, Linux kernel 1.2.0 was released, with 310,950 lines of code.
en-000002915	On 21 July 2011, Torvalds announced the release of Linux kernel 3.0: "Gone are the 2.6.<bignum> days".
en-000002916	The version bump is not about major technological changes when compared to Linux 2.6.39; it marks the kernel's 20th anniversary.
en-000002917	The debate, started in 1992 on the Usenet discussion group comp.os.minix, was about Linux and kernel architecture in general.
en-000002918	Tanenbaum argued that microkernels are superior to monolithic kernels and that therefore Linux is obsolete.
en-000002919	This subject was revisited on 9 May 2006, and on 12 May 2006 Tanenbaum wrote a position statement.
en-000002920	Including previous years, three billion Android smartphones were estimated to have been sold by the end of 2014.
en-000002921	Initially, Torvalds released Linux under a license which forbade any commercial use.
en-000002922	This was changed in version 0.12 to the GNU General Public License (GPL).
en-000002923	Torvalds has described licensing Linux under the GPL as the "best thing I ever did."
en-000002924	Torvalds himself specifically indicated upon the release of version 2.4.0 that his own code is only under version 2.
en-000002925	In September 2006, a survey of 29 key kernel programmers indicated that 28 preferred GPLv2 to the then-current GPLv3 draft.
en-000002926	They referred to clauses regarding DRM/tivoization, patents, "additional restrictions" and warned a Balkanisation of the "Open Source Universe" by the GPLv3.
en-000002927	Linus Torvalds, who decided not to adopt the GPLv3 for the Linux kernel, reiterated his criticism even years later.
en-000002928	Alan Cox replied on LKML, rejecting a request from one of their engineers to remove this technical enforcement from the API.
en-000002929	Ultimately, it is likely that such questions can only be resolved by a court.
en-000002930	One point of licensing controversy is the use of firmware "binary blobs" in Linux kernel to support several hardware devices.
en-000002931	This policy was continued to be applied in later stable Debian releases.
en-000002932	Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the United States and some other countries.
en-000002933	Several Linux backers retained legal counsel and filed suit against Della Croce.
en-000002934	The issue was settled in August 1997 when the trademark was assigned to Linus Torvalds.
en-000002935	IBM then promised to defend its Linux customers on their behalf.
en-000002936	In early 2007, SCO filed the specific details of the purported copyright infringement.
en-000002937	The jury case was decided on 30 March 2010 in Novell's favour.
en-000002938	The graphics system most people use with Linux does not run within the kernel.
en-000002939	Unlike standard monolithic kernels, device drivers are easily configured as modules, and loaded or unloaded while the system is running.
en-000002940	In 2004, Intel claimed to have modified the kernel so that its C compiler was also capable of compiling it.
en-000002941	There was another such reported success in 2009, with a modified 2.6.22 version of the kernel.
en-000002942	The project dedicated to this effort is named "LLVMLinux" after the LLVM compiler infrastructure upon which Clang is built.
en-000002943	Conformance to standards is a general policy for the Linux kernel's internals.
en-000002944	The Linux kernel API of the Linux kernel, representing the kernel's system call interface, is composed of the available system calls.
en-000002945	There are a couple of kernel internal APIs utilized between the different subsystems and subsystems of subsystems.
en-000002946	Some of them have been kept stable over several releases, other have not.
en-000002947	Maintainers and contributors are free to augment or change them at any time.
en-000002948	Examples of in-kernel APIs include software frameworks/APIs for the following classes of device drivers:
en-000002949	Some organizations have strongly supported defining and maintaining of a stable in-kernel ABI over several releases.
en-000002950	By default the kernel uses a scheduler mechanism called the Completely Fair Scheduler introduced in the 2.6.23 version of the kernel.
en-000002951	Partial mainline integration of the real-time Linux kernel patch already brought some functionality to the kernel mainline.
en-000002952	Preemption improves latency, increases responsiveness, and makes Linux more suitable for desktop and real-time applications.
en-000002953	Linux runs as the main operating system on IBM's Blue Gene and other fastest supercomputers.
en-000002954	Linux has also been ported to various handheld devices such as Apple's iPod and iPhone.
en-000002955	However, most panics are the result of unhandled processor exceptions in kernel code, such as references to invalid memory addresses.
en-000002956	These are typically indicative of a bug somewhere in the call chain leading to the panic.
en-000002957	The kernel panic message might not be printed visibly in some conditions, such as when using a graphical desktop.
en-000002958	To debug such conditions, other methods such as attaching a serial port console can be used.
en-000002959	Rebootless updates can even be applied to the kernel by using live patching technologies such as Ksplice, kpatch and kGraft.
en-000002960	For example, they may allow for privilege escalation or create denial-of-service attack vectors.
en-000002961	Russia is blamed for denial-of-service attacks on Estonia and Georgia.
en-000002962	Over the years, numerous such flaws were found and fixed in the Linux kernel.
en-000002963	New security features are frequently implemented to improve the Linux kernel's security.
en-000002964	Linux distributions typically release security updates to fix vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel.
en-000002965	Many offer long-term support releases that receive security updates for a certain Linux kernel version for an extended period of time.
en-000002966	Version 1.0 of the Linux kernel was released on 14 March 1994.
en-000002967	This release of the Linux kernel only supported single-processor i386-based computer systems.
en-000002968	Version 2.4.0, released on 4 January 2001, contained support for ISA Plug and Play, USB, and PC Cards.
en-000002969	"x" changed further towards including new features throughout the duration of the series.
en-000002970	Also notable are the addition of several file systems throughout the 2.6.
en-000002971	On 30 May 2011, Torvalds announced that the big change was"NOTHING.
en-000002972	After the expected 6–7 weeks of the development process, it would be released near the 20th anniversary of Linux.
en-000002973	There were no meaningful technical reasons for the numbering change from 2.6.39 to 3.0, or from 3.19 to 4.0.
en-000002974	The major version number was increased just to avoid large minor numbers.
en-000002975	Another important extension to the Linux kernel is the addition of more supported hardware platforms.
en-000002976	The architecture of the system supports this extensibility by separating all hardware-specific code into distinct modules within each subsystem.
en-000002977	This topic was revisited in October 2008 by Amanda McPherson, Brian Proffitt and Ron Hale-Evans.
en-000002978	The development model for the 2.6 kernel series was significantly different compared to the 2.5 series.
en-000002979	Both of these branches had been maintained by the same set of people, led by Torvalds.
en-000002980	The 2.5 branch was then eventually declared stable and renamed to 2.6.
en-000002981	Since then, the "stable team" had been formed, and it would keep updating kernel versions with bug fixes.
en-000002982	In October 2008 Adrian Bunk announced that he will maintain 2.6.27 for a few years as a replacement of 2.6.16.
en-000002983	Most Linux users run a kernel supplied by their Linux distribution.
en-000002984	In 2002, Linux kernel development switched to BitKeeper, an SCM system which satisfied Torvalds'technical requirements.
en-000002985	The system did provide some interoperability with free SCM systems such as CVS and Subversion.
en-000002986	In response, Torvalds and others wrote a new source code control system for the purpose, called Git.
en-000002987	The new system was written within weeks, and in two months the first official kernel release was made using Git.
en-000002988	Git soon developed into a separate project in its own right and gained widespread adoption.
en-000002989	This was followed by 0.02, 0.03, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12 (the first GPL version), 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.98, 0.99 and then 1.0.
en-000002990	Version 3.0 was released in 2011, but it was not a major change in kernel concept.
en-000002991	The major revision was assigned according to the even–odd version numbering scheme.
en-000002992	The minor revision had been changed whenever security patches, bug fixes, new features or drivers were implemented in the kernel.
en-000002993	A fourth number was sometimes added to account for bug and security fixes (only) to the kernel version.
en-000002994	The even-odd system of alternation between stable and unstable was gone.
en-000002995	However, there were not enough other changes to legitimize the release of a new minor revision (which would have been 2.6.9).
en-000002996	So, 2.6.8.1 was released, with the only change being the fix of that error.
en-000002997	With 2.6.11, this was adopted as the new official versioning policy.
en-000002998	The major version number was also later raised to 4, for the release following version 3.19.
en-000002999	For example, "ck" stands for Con Kolivas, "ac" stands for Alan Cox, etc.
en-000003000	Also, distributors may have their own suffixes with different numbering systems and for back-ports to their "enterprise" (i.e.
en-000003001	There are certain variants of the Linux kernel that provide additional functionality, but do not belong to the Linux kernel mainline.
en-000003002	Such variants of the Linux kernel include Linux-libre, Compute Node Linux, Cooperative Linux, grsecurity, INK, L4Linux, MkLinux, RTLinux, and User-mode Linux.
en-000003003	Some of these variants have been partially merged into the mainline.
en-000003004	KSAs are used to determine, along with résumés, who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job.
en-000003005	The knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) necessary for the successful performance of a position are contained on each job vacancy announcement.
en-000003006	A series of KSA statements are usually required when applying for most federal government and some state and city government jobs.
en-000003007	Most government hiring officials look for a short, crisp, and clear KSA that emphasizes results or accomplishments obtained in previous work.
en-000003008	In short, India’s government should look for ways to sustain America’s interest in India during difficult times.
en-000003009	Other agencies sometimes call them "Rating Factors", "Quality Ranking Factors", "Knowledge, Abilities, skills, and Other Characteristics", or "Job Elements".
en-000003010	The name can be just a name but it often influences content and length of the essay.
en-000003011	The below definitions are defined by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management:
en-000003012	The scoring of KSA essays is based on a scale of from 1 to 100.
en-000003013	Job applicants must score above 70 to be considered for the position.
en-000003014	When applying to federal government positions, a Federal Resume is usually required in addition to KSA statements.
en-000003015	Also known as Shineway Group in English-speaking countries, the company's businesses include hog raising, consumer meat products, flavoring products, and logistics.
en-000003016	Shuanghui has 13 facilities that produce more than 2.7 million tons of meat per year.
en-000003017	It slaughters more than 15 million pigs a year, but only raises about 400,000– the rest are purchased from suppliers.
en-000003018	The company holds more than 500 patents and produces 1,000 different products.
en-000003019	The company employs over 60,000 people and is 30% employee owned.
en-000003020	Shuanghui was set up by the local Luohe city government in 1958 as a single processing plant.
en-000003021	The company introduced its first branded meat product to the market in February 1992.
en-000003022	Later that year, Shuanghui formed a joint venture with 16 institutional investors across six countries.
en-000003023	By 2006, Shuanghui was the largest (by company value) food processor in China, and 131st largest company overall.
en-000003024	The company was valued at $1.3 billion, and controlled more than 50% of China's high-temperature processed meat market at that time.
en-000003025	Goldman Sachs later sold most of its share, reportedly for a large profit.
en-000003026	In 2011, state-owned CCTV revealed that Shuanghui pork contained clenbuterol, a banned chemical that can be harmful to humans.
en-000003027	Including assumed debt, the total value of the deal is about $7.1 billion.
en-000003028	The agreed purchase price represents a 31% premium over Smithfield's market price at the time of the deal.
en-000003029	The businesses had been in discussion for four years before they were able to come to terms.
en-000003030	However, "The Wall Street Journal" said deal "unlikely to face serious opposition" from regulators.
en-000003031	Several congressman expressed concerns over the purchase, but stopped short of saying they would oppose it.
en-000003032	No Chinese pork would be imported to the United States, he stated, but rather Shuanghui desired to export American pork.
en-000003033	There is a growing demand for foreign food products in China due to recent food scandals.
en-000003034	So, as incomes grow, demand for food products grows even faster.
en-000003035	Smithfield's existing management team would remain intact and no major changes to its workforce would occur.
en-000003036	If completed, the deal will be the largest ever takeover of a U.S. company by a Chinese company.
en-000003037	It will roughly double the number of US jobs tied to direct investment by China.
en-000003038	The previous largest takeover was Dalian Wanda Group's acquisition of AMC Theaters for $2.6 billion.
en-000003039	Smithfield will cease to be publicly traded at the deal's completion.
en-000003040	The IPO would see the firm valued at around $4 billion.
en-000003041	An early parliamentary election was held in Kuwait on 16 May 2009, the country's third in a three-year period.
en-000003042	In December 2011, the country’s parliamentary election triggered a civic explosion.
en-000003043	The government had resigned just two days before to evade questioning in parliament.
en-000003044	Liberals won at least 8 seats while Independent candidates won 20 seats.
en-000003045	Aseel al-Awadhi and Rola Dashti were victors in the third district.
en-000003046	When voting was first introduced in Kuwait in 1985, Kuwaiti women had the right to vote.
en-000003047	Women in Kuwait were later re-granted the right to vote and stand in parliamentary and local elections in May 2005.
en-000003048	Sunni Islamists lost more than 10 seats less than the 2008 elections.
en-000003049	The protests took several forms, including human chains, demonstrations, rallies, hunger strikes, and self-immolation.
en-000003050	Following the Tamil Nadu protests, protests began to take place in other cities across the globe.
en-000003051	In Australia, several protests took place in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.
en-000003052	Over a thousand protested during Sri Lankan foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama's visit to Australia on 14 October 2008.
en-000003053	The protest took place in Canberra outside the National Press Club.
en-000003054	As of April, 60 rallies and protests had occurred across Australia.
en-000003055	On 11 April, three Australian protesters began hunger strikes, like those concurrently occurring in Ottawa and London.
en-000003056	On 17 April, a "March for Peace" took place in Canberra.
en-000003057	A "Boycott Sri Lankan Products" campaign was launched in Sydney during the last week of April.
en-000003058	The demonstrations occurred with a few roads being closed down to make way.
en-000003059	A series of demonstrations and protests took place in major Canadian cities.
en-000003060	Demonstrations begin in major cities, calling for an end to corruption among party officials.
en-000003061	In India, protests took place primarily in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
en-000003062	With regard to sentiments among those deceased in the war, several individuals had self immolated themselves on various days.
en-000003063	Those who self immolated themselves were Muthukumar, Murugathasan, Amaresan, Pallapatti Ravi, Gokularathinam,
en-000003064	Although no one was hurt, it did cause severe damage to the Embassy of Sri Lanka.
en-000003065	Hundreds of Tamils gathered in Bergen, organising a 48-hour famine protest starting on 20 November.
en-000003066	A larger scaled protest occurred on 31 January 2009 which attracted a crowd of around 150,000 Tamils.
en-000003067	On 6 April an ongoing protest began, which continued into the middle of May.
en-000003068	The next major protest took place on 11 April 2009, which attracted more than 200,000 Tamils.
en-000003069	Two British Tamils, 21-year-old Sivatharsan Sivakumaravel and 28-year-old Parameswaran Subramanyam, went on hunger strike.
en-000003070	Protests had left the City of London Police with a cost £7.1 million.
en-000003071	The British Human Rights Act grants everyone the right to gather with others and protest.
en-000003072	Subramaniyan denied the "Daily Mail"'s allegations, calling them "entirely baseless" and a "conspiracy to defame the Tamil struggle".
en-000003073	Subramanyam then took legal action for libel against the "Daily Mail" and "The Sun", which had repeated the false claims.
en-000003074	The newspapers accepted that the claims had been "entirely false", apologised to Subramanyam and paid him £77,500 in damages.
en-000003075	The International Hydropower Association (IHA) is a not-for-profit, international organisation and membership association representing the global hydropower sector.
en-000003076	IHA also partners with international organisations, research institutions, governments and civil society.
en-000003077	In fact, the efforts of governments and international institutions point the way toward more sustainable solutions.
en-000003078	It now consists of five departments, a central office (London), a regional office (South America) and a national office (China).
en-000003079	The REN Alliance was established to advance the role of renewable energy systems, and continues to build influence today.
en-000003080	IHA published its first sustainability guidelines for hydropower projects in 2004, followed by the IHA Sustainability Protocol in 2006.
en-000003081	The World Hydropower Congress is now a biennial event and continues to serve as a reference point for the sector.
en-000003082	It has been held in Turkey (2007) Iceland (2009), Brazil (2011), Malaysia (2013) and China (2015).
en-000003083	IHA aims to advance sustainable hydropower’s role in meeting the world’s water and energy needs.
en-000003084	IHA currently has over 100 corporate and affiliate members, including many of the world’s leading hydropower, electricity and construction companies.
en-000003085	IHA organises the biennial World Hydropower Congress, regarded as the key reference for decision-makers and thought leaders in the hydropower sector.
en-000003086	The Board is supported by a Central Office, the administrative arm of the IHA.
en-000003087	There are also a number of committees and groups working on strategic and topical issues formed in accordance with Board resolutions.
en-000003088	IHA's central office is situated in Sutton, Greater London, United Kingdom.
en-000003089	It is an active participant in the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), founded in Bonn, Germany, on 26 January 2009.
en-000003090	The World Bioenergy Association (WBA) subsequently joined the REN Alliance in June 2009.
en-000003091	The Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol, is a comprehensive tool to assess the sustainability of hydropower projects.
en-000003092	It was launched in June 2011 at the International Hydropower Association (IHA) World Congress.
en-000003093	It provides a thorough, evidence-based assessment of between 19-23 relevant sustainability topics, depending on the development stage of the project.
en-000003094	The assessment tools are used as a framework to produce a sustainability profile for a hydropower project.
en-000003095	The Protocol can be used during all stages of hydropower project development: early stage, preparation, implementation and operation.
en-000003096	To date, the Project has involved some 160 researchers, scientists and professionals, from more than 100 institutions.
en-000003097	The overall objective of the project is the evaluation of changes in GHG emissions due to the impoundment of freshwater reservoirs.
en-000003098	A revised version of the tool, G-Res, will allocate emissions to the particular services provided by the reservoir.
en-000003099	A prototype of the revised tool was launched at the World Hydropower Congress in Beijing, in May 2015.
en-000003100	The tool will be applicable for both existing and planned reservoirs.
en-000003101	The GHG Screening Tool provides an estimate of the likely level of total (gross) GHG emissions from a freshwater reservoir.
en-000003102	The tool output provides an indication of the need for further assessment of GHG emissions.
en-000003103	Launched in 2015, the Mosonyi Award for Excellence in Hydropower recognises individuals within IHA's membership for outstanding contributions to the sector.
en-000003104	Proposed candidates are reviewed by a panel convened by the IHA Board.
en-000003105	The panel nominates selected candidates, with the IHA Board making the final decision on the selection of recipients.
en-000003106	Mosonyi, who died in 2009 aged 98, made major contributions during his long career in hydropower.
en-000003107	In collaboration with UNESCO, IHA previously awarded the IHA Blue Planet Prize every two years.
en-000003108	The prize recognizes outstanding performance in sustainable management of hydropower schemes.
en-000003109	The IHA Blue Planet Prize was not awarded during the development phase of the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol.
en-000003110	It was officially relaunched during the 2015 World Hydropower Congress in Beijing, and will be awarded in 2017.
en-000003111	Only projects from Least Developed Countries will be eligible for consideration under the second alternative.
en-000003112	Sudan– United Kingdom relations are foreign relations between Sudan and United Kingdom.
en-000003113	Sudan has an embassy in London whilst the United Kingdom has an embassy in Khartoum.
en-000003114	Most of the recent relations between the two countries centre on the region of Darfur.
en-000003115	Between 1899 and the country's independence in 1956, Sudan (then known as "Anglo-Egyptian Sudan") was an Anglo-Egyptian condominium.
en-000003116	Britain has had relations with Sudan's Islamist government since it took power in a military coup in 1989.
en-000003117	The message for Darfur is that it is a time for change.
en-000003118	Britain is the second largest single country donor to Sudan contributing contributed £175m of aid since 2003
en-000003119	Aid should preferably be financed out of donor countries’ national budgets in a transparent, democratically accountable way.
en-000003120	In 2004, the British government committed 2 planes to help with the aid effort in Darfur.
en-000003121	In 2006, the British government committed USD 76 million to aid efforts in Darfur to help the world's largest aid operation.
en-000003122	British aid organisations British Red Cross, Save the Children and Oxfam were active in Darfur.
en-000003123	In May 2004, Oxfam announced it was increasing its staff in Darfur as it was gravely concerned about the humanitarian crisis.
en-000003124	Around the same time, the Sudanese Government made it easier for aid workers to obtain visas to work in Sudan.
en-000003125	In 2007, Oxfam's operating budget for Sudan's western region was USD12 million.
en-000003126	President al-Bashir accused foreign aid workers of being "spies" and "thieves".
en-000003127	The Embassy of Sudan, London is located on Cleveland Row, close to St James's Palace.
en-000003128	The Tchefuncte Site (16ST1) is an archaeological site that is a type site for the prehistoric Tchefuncte culture period.
en-000003129	It is located in the southeast section of Fontainebleau State Park near Mandeville, St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana.
en-000003130	It was inhabited from 500 BCE to 1 CE during the Tchula period.
en-000003131	Major excavations were directed by Clarence Johnson in 1938 and Edwin Doran in 1941.
en-000003132	The Tchefuncte Site is located in the marsh half a mile north of Lake Pontchartrain in extreme eastern Louisiana.
en-000003133	The middens were composed mainly of shells of the brackish-water clam "Rangia cuneata".
en-000003134	In 1938 construction crews wanted to use shell from the middens for road construction.
en-000003135	The south half had already been destroyed by the commercial dredging.
en-000003136	Johnson then turned his material and notes over to the Louisiana Archaeological Survey in Baton Rouge.
en-000003137	In 1941 further excavations of Midden B and Midden A were under the direction of Edwin B. Doran, Jr.
en-000003138	In 2000 archaeologists from the Regional Archaeology Program mapped the site for a National Register of Historic Places nomination.
en-000003139	They lived in coastal areas and lowlands, usually near slow-moving streams.
en-000003140	The Tchefuncte culture were the first people in Louisiana to make large amounts of pottery.
en-000003141	Pottery was made by coiling clay into shape and then smoothing it to form a container.
en-000003142	Often vessels were decorated by pressing fingernails, twigs, or tools into the surface.
en-000003143	The development of ceramic technology led to improved food management, better storage and cooking techniques.
en-000003144	In the 1980’s, recombinant DNA technology led to the development of vaccines against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus.
en-000003145	Ceramic pots also allowed stewing and other new cooking techniques to be experimented with and developed for the first time.
en-000003146	The Tchefuncte culture was preceded by the Poverty Point culture, and was eventually succeeded by the Marksville culture.

en-000003148	The Australian region is defined as being to south of the equator, between the 90th meridian east and 160th meridian east.
en-000003149	Over the next few days as the low drifted towards the west, the system's low level circulation centre gradually developed further.
en-000003150	Before late on 30 October, the JTWC started issuing advisories on the low as Tropical Cyclone 02S.
en-000003151	Anggrek then passed to the east of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands early on 2 November.
en-000003152	On November 5, the remnants of Anggrek entered the south-west Indian Ocean as a convectiveless circulation center.
en-000003153	Throughout the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, heavy rain and gusty winds were experienced as Cyclone Anggrek passed.
en-000003154	Only minor damage was reported, with several trees and power lines brought down.
en-000003155	On 15 December a monsoonal low developed about 500 km north-west of Exmouth, Western Australia.
en-000003156	It moved away from the coast and dissipated late on 20 December some 500 km west of Geraldton.
en-000003157	The rain also affected other river basins in the area, such as Wooramel, Murchison, Lyndon-Minilya, and Ashburton rivers.
en-000003158	The highest 24 hours rainfall was reported at Carnarvon Airport on 17 December.
en-000003159	Preliminary estimates placed damage at A$100 million (US$100.4 million) with at least 2000 head of cattle lost in the flood.
en-000003160	In late December, a low pressure area was tracked for several days moving westwards towards Queensland.
en-000003161	Rainfall of about 100 mm was recorded in the space of an hour.
en-000003162	At the end of December, a Tropical Low developed inland over the Top End of Western Australia.
en-000003163	After that, the low continued to strengthen, as it moved farther out west in the Indian Ocean.
en-000003164	The system gradually intensified and became a Category 1 tropical cyclone on 12 January, receiving the name "Vince".
en-000003165	The system subsequently made landfall on the Queensland east coast near Bowen and rapidly weakened over land.
en-000003166	Early on 21 January TCWC Darwin reported that Tropical Low 12U had developed within the Gulf of Carpentaria.
en-000003167	A few hours later, TCWC Perth upgraded the low into a Category 1 Tropical Cyclone, naming it Bianca.
en-000003168	Early on the next day, TCWC Perth further upgraded Bianca to a Category 2 Tropical Cyclone.
en-000003169	Intensification continued and late on the same day, TCWC Perth upgraded Bianca into a Category 3 Severe Tropical Cyclone.
en-000003170	The system continued to intensify and became a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on 28 January.
en-000003171	On the same day, the system started weakening rapidly and TCWC Perth downgraded Bianca into a Category 3 Severe Tropical Cyclone.
en-000003172	Rain and strong winds were experienced along the Kimberley coast on 25 January.
en-000003173	On 26 January, Bianca moved away from Kimberley and weather conditions started to improve.
en-000003174	Bianca disrupted operations in Australia's major iron ore port and several oil facilities.
en-000003175	In Western Australia, preparations were underway as the system was soon expected to approach land.
en-000003176	The last cyclone to track south of Perth was Cyclone Ned in 1989.
en-000003177	A Cyclone Warning was issued for the area between just north of Jurien Bay and Albany, including Perth.
en-000003178	However, the warnings were cancelled on 30 January as Bianca dissipated south of Western Australia in the afternoon of 30 January.
en-000003179	Two deaths were attributed to damaging severe thunderstorms that formed along the storm's outer rainbands.
en-000003180	Yasi entered the Australian region from the South Pacific basin on 31 January.
en-000003181	By the time Yasi crossed into the basin, preparations for the storm were under way.
en-000003182	Media outlets referred to the storm as "what could be the state's worst cyclone in history."
en-000003183	Thousands of residents in the path of the storm were urged to evacuate by Premier Anna Bligh.
en-000003184	Yasi crossed the Queensland coast near Mission Beach shortly after midnight (local time) on 3 February.
en-000003185	At that time, the large destructive core around the eye extended between Innisfail and Cardwell, Queensland.
en-000003186	Yasi was the second costliest tropical cyclone in Australia's history after Cyclone Tracy, as well as the costliest without inflation.
en-000003187	Later that day, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system under the name 14S.
en-000003188	On 14 February TCWC Perth reported that Tropical Low 14U had developed to the northwest of Port Hedland, Western Australia.
en-000003189	Over the next few days the system remained well offshore and drifted towards the west southwest while slowly intensifying.
en-000003190	A Cyclone watch had been issued for the coastal communities between Onslow to Coral Bay.
en-000003191	Late on 16 February, the low formed into Tropical Cyclone Dianne whilst 445 km NW of Exmouth.
en-000003192	Dianne intensified as expected and was upgraded to a Category 2 cyclone on 18 February whilst slowly moving towards the SSW.
en-000003193	On 19 February the system intensified into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone.
en-000003194	A severe weather warning was issued for northwest Darwin-Daly District and the Tiwi Islands.
en-000003195	Schools in Darwin, Darwin International Airport and East Arm Wharf were closed.
en-000003196	The system moved slowly southwest on 18 February moving towards the Northern Territory/Western Australian border with a possibility of restrengthening.
en-000003197	But incremental steps had been slowly moving the system in the right direction since the 1980s.
en-000003198	On 19 February the system passed into the Northern Kimberley region.
en-000003199	On 22 February the system moved parallel to the Pilbara coast.
en-000003200	As Carlos moved away from the western coast of Australia on 24 February it strengthened into a Severe Tropical Cyclone.
en-000003201	Carlos also bought a mini tornado to Ellenbrook, Perth, Western Australia on February 28.
en-000003202	On 25 February, the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Perth
en-000003203	In the early hours of 28 February the tropical low moved inland from King Sound.
en-000003204	The tropical low continued moving overland and the BOM issued their final advisory on 28 February.
en-000003205	Over the next couple of days the low remained slow moving.
en-000003206	Over the next couple of days the low moved towards the west and briefly moved into the South West Indian Ocean.
en-000003207	However, on 2 April, Tropical Low 27U dissipated completely over open waters.
en-000003208	He left Morgan Stanley abruptly in October 2006 when an internal email that he penned was leaked.
en-000003209	He derided Singapore as a money laundering centre for Indonesia, and the ASEAN group of nations as a failure.
en-000003210	He joined Morgan Stanley in 1997 as a Managing Director, and is noted for his provocative views on the Chinese economy.
en-000003211	His bearish calls on Shanghai property and Chinese stock market have attracted criticism from Chinese officials and retail investors.
en-000003212	Xie considers himself as one who has had a reasonably good record at calling bubbles in the past.
en-000003213	On the other hand I have never called something a bubble that turned out not to be a bubble."
en-000003214	Xie considers FED monetary policy is the base of international capital flow.
en-000003215	Whenever there is a loose Fed monetary policy, cheap credits flow to developing countries and create economic bubbles.
en-000003216	Creation of a “policy space” for developing countries in WTO agreements.
en-000003217	Xie described the Chinese economy as a "Panda Economy", which is named after "Kung Fu Panda"—a popular Hollywood cartoon movie.
en-000003218	However, the real estate bubble might kill consumer demand in China.
en-000003219	He warned that if no structural reform is initiated, the world economy will go back to a 1970s era of stagflation.
en-000003220	It can do so via distributing shares of the State-owned companies (SoE) to its citizens and lowering housing costs.
en-000003221	Chinese land policy and short term government behaviors provide the perfect ground for a semi-permanent property bubble.
en-000003222	In 2003, Xie warned that China needed to free up capital markets to avoid losing potential economic growth
en-000003223	On 11 April 2009, Xie wrote on his blog that a bear market rally was underway.
en-000003224	He suggested that stimulus, inventory cycle and capex spending would provide tailwind for the rally.
en-000003225	He also wrote that a second dip would occur in 2010.
en-000003226	As of 26 August 2009, the S&P 500 has risen 20.0% to 1028 from 858 on 13 April 2009.
en-000003227	"America's policy is pushing China towards developing an alternative financial system.
en-000003228	China is aware that it must become independent from the dollar at some point.
en-000003229	Its recent decision to turn Shanghai into a financial centre by 2020 reflects China's anxiety over relying on the dollar system."
en-000003230	On 3 August 2009, Xie wrote that "Chinese asset markets have become a giant Ponzi scheme".
en-000003231	He wrote"I want to make myself perfectly clear on China's asset markets today.
en-000003232	Xie explained that there was bubble in the real estate market but the bubble might not burst.
en-000003233	Xie's bearish calls brought broad criticisms from local Chinese "Pundits" and domestic retail investors.
en-000003234	These local Chinese "pundits" include scholars from universities, local governments and investment advisers.
en-000003235	Some suggest that the Chinese asset market is deeply undervalued and return on equity (ROE) analysis is not applicable in China.
en-000003236	The practitioner or teacher may facilitate this process in person to an individual or a group.
en-000003237	There are two fundamental ways by which mental imagery is generated: voluntary and involuntary.
en-000003238	The involuntary and spontaneous generation of mental images is integral to ordinary sensory perception, and cognition, and occurs without volitional intent.
en-000003239	Guided imagery is therefore the assisted simulation or re-creation of perceptual experience across sensory modalities.
en-000003240	Mental imagery, especially visual and auditory imagery, can exacerbate and aggravate a number of mental and physical conditions.
en-000003241	The following elaborates the way in which such mental imagery contributes to or aggravates four specific conditions:
en-000003242	Thereby, mental imagery contributes to the maintenance and persistence of social anxiety, as it does with posttraumatic stress disorder.
en-000003243	In addition, people suffering from depression have difficulty in evoking prospective imagery indicative of a positive future.
en-000003244	Prospective mental imagery indicative of hyperactivity or mania and hopelessness contributes to the manic and depressive episodes respectively in bipolar disorder.
en-000003245	Depressive mental disorders also have been known for as long as written records have been kept.
en-000003246	Image generation involves generating mental imagery, either directly from sensory data and perceptual experience, or from memory, or from fantasy.
en-000003247	Once generated and maintained, a mental image can be inspected to provide the basis for interpretation, and transformation.
en-000003248	As a result, symptoms become less incapacitating, pain is to some degree decreased, while coping skills increase.
en-000003249	Evidence and explanations for the effectiveness and limitations of creative visualization come from two discreet sources: cognitive psychology and psychoneuroimmunology.
en-000003250	This use of guided imagery is based on the following premise.
en-000003251	France reasserted its colonial dominance and a war ensued between France and the Viet Minh, led by Ho.
en-000003252	The Viet Minh ("League for the Independence of Vietnam") was a coalition of nationalist groups, mostly led by communists.
en-000003253	Between 1946 and 1954, the Viet Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas of Vietnam.
en-000003254	The northern zone was commonly called North Vietnam and the southern zone South Vietnam, or, formally, the Republic of Vietnam.
en-000003255	Supervision of the implementation of the Geneva Accords was the responsibility of an International Commission consisting of India, Canada, and Poland.
en-000003256	He said that South Vietnam had not signed the Geneva accords and was not bound by it.
en-000003257	North Vietnam also supported indigenous communist rebels in Cambodia and Laos against their respective U.S,-backed governments.
en-000003258	Viet Minh leader Hồ Chí Minh became head of the government.
en-000003259	On September 12, 1945, the first British troops arrived in Saigon.
en-000003260	In June 1946, Chinese Nationalist troops evacuated Hanoi, and on the 15th of June, the last detachments embarked at Haiphong.
en-000003261	In January 1946, the Viet Minh held an election to establish a National Assembly.
en-000003262	In November, the National Assembly adopted the first Constitution of the Republic.
en-000003263	The French reoccupied Hanoi and the First Indochina War (1946–54) followed.
en-000003264	Following the Chinese Communist Revolution (1946−50), Chinese communist forces arrived on the border in 1949.
en-000003265	Chinese aid revived the fortunes of the Viet Minh and transformed it from a guerrilla militia into a standing army.
en-000003266	The CIA ran a propaganda campaign to get Catholics to come to the south.
en-000003267	Concurrently, between 14,000 and 45,000 civilians and approximately 100,000 Viet Minh fighters moved in the opposite direction.
en-000003268	The communists rejected the "American Plan" to hold reunification elections monitored by the United Nations to ensure fairness.
en-000003269	Prisoners were abused and beaten as well as intensely hard labor forced upon them.
en-000003270	Many died of exhaustion, starvation, illness (who often died without any medical attention), or assault by prison guards.
en-000003271	Tien's poems are published in several books, including "Flowers from Hell" and "Hanoi Hilton Stories by Nguyen Chi Thien".
en-000003272	However, aftermath documents show that Democratic Republic of Vietnam obeyed international regulations of treatment for POWs.
en-000003273	A puritan personality cult was also established around Ho Chi Minh, later extended nationwide after the Communist reunification
en-000003274	of the Vietnam, and is reminiscent to other Communist nations like North Korea, the Soviet Union, and China.
en-000003275	Land reform was an integral part of the Viet Minh and communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
en-000003276	The total number of rural people impacted by the land reform program was more than 4 million.
en-000003277	However it was carried out with violence and repression primarily directed against large landowners identified, sometimes incorrectly, as landlords.
en-000003278	Severe rioting protesting the excesses of the land reform program broke out in November 1956 in one largely-Catholic rural district.
en-000003279	About 1,000 people were killed or injured and several thousand imprisoned.
en-000003280	As part of the correction campaign as many as 23,748 political prisoners were released by North Vietnam by September 1957.
en-000003281	The number of persons actually executed by communist cadre carrying out the land reform program has been variously estimated.
en-000003282	Author Michael Lind in a 2013 book gives a similar estimate of "at least ten or fifteen thousand" executed.
en-000003283	By 1961, 86 percent of farmers were members of low-level cooperatives.
en-000003284	By 1971, the great majority of farmers in North Vietnam were organized into high-level cooperatives.
en-000003285	However it was seen as a puppet government of North Vietnam.
en-000003286	Troops and supplies were sent along the Ho Chi Minh trail.
en-000003287	China and the Soviet Union provided aid to and troops in support of North Vietnamese military activities.
en-000003288	This was known as the Vietnam War, or the "American War" in Vietnam itself (1955–75).
en-000003289	The remaining two-thirds were inadvertent war casualties or civilians killed by South Vietnamese and allied forces.
en-000003290	These insurgencies were aided by the Hanoi government, which sent troops to fight alongside them.
en-000003291	In 1989, the Chinese Government sent troops to repress the country’s pro-democracy movement.
en-000003292	In 1969, Sweden became the first Western country to extend full diplomatic recognition to North Vietnam.
en-000003293	Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC’s earlier use of oil as a political weapon.
en-000003294	Food has a major influence on political actions of a nation.
en-000003295	In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.
en-000003296	Food power is an integral part of the politics of food.
en-000003297	The idea of food power is used in embargoes, employment, and food politics.
en-000003298	Forced to rely on these nations in times of shortage, food-importing countries may face food crises if needed supplies are withheld.
en-000003299	Food politics are the political aspects of the production, control, regulation, inspection and distribution of food.
en-000003300	Food power is an integral part of the politics of food.
en-000003301	“Food is a weapon”, stated Earl Butz, the United States Secretary of Agriculture, in 1974.
en-000003302	An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made.
en-000003303	This would have the same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have.
en-000003304	Food security is when all people of a region at all times have enough food for an active, healthy life.
en-000003305	Food power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc.
en-000003306	takes this security away in order to get something in return.
en-000003307	Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country's food security.
en-000003308	This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating food power.
en-000003309	An embargo is not the same as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo.
en-000003310	In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of restricted items often fail.
en-000003311	For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany.
en-000003312	However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials.
en-000003313	After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food.
en-000003314	In the early 1980s, the United States posed a grain embargo upon the Soviet Union.
en-000003315	This was an attempt by the U.S. utilize food power, however, it was not confirmed.
en-000003316	Another unsuccessful embargo food power attempt was imposed by the UN Security Council in 1990 with Iraq.
en-000003317	Another example of an embargo is the United States embargo against Cuba.
en-000003318	The four conditions listed above MUST be simultaneously present in order to turn an economic asset food into a political instrument.
en-000003319	There are several uses for employing economic weapons against one country or another.
en-000003320	One use for using economic weapons would concern the seller/buyer bargaining on the conditions of a business contract.
en-000003321	Although this is an example of the successful application of food power, it is not a political objective.
en-000003322	A political use would be one concerning the buyer’s foreign and defense policies.
en-000003323	Many believe there is a moral threshold between economy and politics, making the use of economic means for political gains questionable.
en-000003324	During the time the United States was the most dominant in all areas like military, energy, exports, etc.
en-000003325	However, since some of those powers have since diminished, the power of food has come to the surface.
en-000003326	In the realm of food, The United States remains at the top, unchallenged.
en-000003327	The United States has the position of being the largest producer and exporter of food.
en-000003328	This allows the United States to expect friendly behavior from the countries that import American food.
en-000003329	Countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off.
en-000003330	The U.S. frequently uses its economic power in order to punish other countries.
en-000003331	One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food.
en-000003332	This is the result of a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system.
en-000003333	The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food.
en-000003334	The worst affected area was Bahr El Ghazal in southwestern Sudan.
en-000003335	In China, plug-in electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).
en-000003336	Plug-in cars have several benefits compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.
en-000003337	They have lower operating and maintenance costs, and produce little or no local air pollution.
en-000003338	Plug-in hybrids capture most of these benefits when they are operating in all-electric mode.
en-000003339	Plug-in electric vehicles are also sometimes referred to as grid-enabled vehicles (GEV) and also as electrically chargeable vehicles.
en-000003340	A battery electric vehicle (BEV) uses chemical energy stored in rechargeable battery packs as its only source for propulsion.
en-000003341	BEVs use electric motors and motor controllers instead of internal combustion engines (ICEs) for propulsion.
en-000003342	The Chinese government began implementation of its NEV program in 2009 to foster the development and introduction of new energy vehicles.
en-000003343	Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle.
en-000003344	The Volt cost per mile is higher because it is heavier than the Leaf.
en-000003345	The previous operating costs do not include maintenance, depreciation or other costs.
en-000003346	PEVs do not require oil changes and other routine maintenance checks.
en-000003347	This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles.
en-000003348	The magnitude of the potential advantage depends on the mix of generation sources and therefore varies by country and by region.
en-000003349	The U.K. also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as natural gas plants dominate the generation mix.
en-000003350	However these countries and regions might still obtain some air quality benefits by reducing local air pollution in urban areas.
en-000003351	Nevertheless, the location of the plants is not relevant when considering greenhouse gas emission because their effect is global.
en-000003352	The higher carbon footprint during production of electric drive vehicles is due mainly to the production of batteries.
en-000003353	The following table summarizes key results of this study for four powertrain technologies:
en-000003354	In 2014 Volkswagen published the results of life-cycle assessment of its electric vehicles certified by TÜV NORD, and independent inspection agency.
en-000003355	Accounting for the full lifecycle, the e-Golf reduces emissions by 61%, offsetting higher production emissions.
en-000003356	Similar results were found when comparing the e-Golf with the Golf 1.6 TDI.
en-000003357	The analysis considered recycling of the three vehicles at the end of their lifetime.
en-000003358	For purposes of an accurate estimation of emissions, the analysis took into consideration the differences in operation between plug-in hybrids.
en-000003359	Since all-electric cars do not produce tailpipe emissions, the utility factor applies only to plug-in hybrids.
en-000003360	In September 2014 the UCS published an updated analysis of its 2012 report.
en-000003361	First, electric utilities have adopted cleaner sources of electricity to their mix between the two analysis.
en-000003362	In states with a cleaner mix generation, the gains were larger.
en-000003363	Electricity generation has been getting cleaner, as coal-fired generation has declined while lower-carbon alternatives have increased.
en-000003364	A study published in the UK in April 2013 assessed the carbon footprint of plug-in electric vehicles in 20 countries.
en-000003365	The study found that in countries with coal-intensive generation, PEVs are no different from conventional petrol-powered vehicles.
en-000003366	Among these countries are China, Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and India.
en-000003367	Countries ranking in the middle include Japan, Germany, the UK and the United States.
en-000003368	For many net oil importing countries the 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis.
en-000003369	Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil.
en-000003370	The following table summarizes the results of four of the seven scenarios analyzed by the study.
en-000003371	For comparison, the study constructed average hybrid and conventional vehicles and assumed an average US distance per trip distribution.
en-000003372	Even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers.
en-000003373	However, this infrastructure is not in place and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors.
en-000003374	The public sector dominates investment, and the bulk of public investment is financed by foreign grants.
en-000003375	Some local private firms such as Google and Adobe Systems have also deployed charging infrastructure.
en-000003376	Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the battery pack.
en-000003377	Better Place signed agreement for deployment in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Canada, California, and Hawaii.
en-000003378	was the electric car built with switchable battery technology sold for the Better Place network.
en-000003379	cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark.

en-000003623	He was the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for London's Hampstead and Kilburn constituency in the 2015 general election.
en-000003624	He is also the founding chairman of Quilliam, a counter-extremism think tank that seeks to challenge the narratives of Islamist extremists.
en-000003625	Born in Southend-on-Sea, Essex to a British Pakistani family, Nawaz is a former member of the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir.
en-000003626	This association led to his arrest in Egypt in December 2001, where he remained imprisoned until 2006.
en-000003627	This led Nawaz to leave Hizb-ut-Tahrir in 2007, renounce his Islamist past and call for a "Secular Islam".
en-000003628	After his turnaround, Nawaz co-founded Quilliam with former Islamists, including Ed Husain.
en-000003629	Since then, he has become a prominent critic of Islamism in the United Kingdom.
en-000003630	He is a weekly columnist for "The Daily Beast", and hosts his LBC radio show every weekend 12-3 pm.
en-000003631	In June 2014, Nawaz became an honorary associate of the National Secular Society.
en-000003632	His second book "Islam and the Future of Tolerance" (2015), co-authored with American neuroscientist Sam Harris, was published in October 2015.
en-000003633	Nawaz was born in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England to parents of Pakistani origin.
en-000003634	His mother, Abi, is described as a literature-loving liberal woman whose family moved to Southend when she was nine.
en-000003635	In his memoir, "Radical", he uses the pseudonym Osman to denote his brother.
en-000003636	Nawaz was educated at Westcliff High School for Boys, a grammar school in Westcliff-on-Sea, a suburb of Southend.
en-000003637	On Nawaz's decision to leave Hizb ut-Tahrir, they separated and divorced.
en-000003638	Nawaz has opposed racial profiling of Muslims, extrajudicial detention of terror suspects, torture, targeted killings and drone strikes.
en-000003639	According to him, security should never debase citizens of their civil liberties.
en-000003640	He criticises the idea of political correctness, and the hesitation of democrats in asserting the universality of democratic norms.
en-000003641	He also points to the political failure of many states in the Muslim world as a contributing factor.
en-000003642	The political failure of democratic parties is taken as a failure of democracy itself in the Muslim world.
en-000003643	In the new democracies of the postcommunist world, such two-party systems never came into being.
en-000003644	Without any exposure to the complexities of modern life, he argues, such teens are susceptible to simplistic worldviews and dogma.
en-000003645	It begins with a sense of real or perceived grievances, which leads to an identity crisis.
en-000003646	Nawaz defines Islamism as a desire to impose any given interpretation of Islam over society.

en-000003650	He advocates a doctrine of "legal tolerance, civic intolerance" in dealing with such issues.
en-000003651	He also blamed misguided multicultural policies of the 90s for creating "monocultural ghettos".
en-000003652	Liberalism, he wrote, should seek out the individual, not the stereotype of the community he belongs to.
en-000003653	According to him, far-right xenophobes and Islamists agree upon one thing: the impossibility of Muslim and non-Muslim cohabitation in Europe.
en-000003654	As a solution, he proposes the assertion of liberalism which can shine through the fogs of these extremes.
en-000003655	In a CNN interview, he condemned Donald Trump's remarks about banning Muslims from entering the United States.
en-000003656	Osman subsequently persuaded Nawaz to attend HT meetings held in Southend homes.
en-000003657	At those meetings, recruits were shown videos that depicted Bosnian Muslims being massacred.
en-000003658	With his identity crisis lurking in the background, these videos became the catalyst for Nawaz's formal recruitment in the HT.
en-000003659	While a student at Newham College, and then at SOAS, Nawaz quickly rose through the ranks.
en-000003660	He was then transferred with fellow foreign prisoners, including Ian Nisbet and Reza Pankhurst, to Mazrah Tora prison.

en-000003666	On the liberal end of the spectrum, he befriended author and sociologist Saad Eddin Ibrahim.
en-000003667	His departure from Hizb ut-Tahrir's world view came slowly and gradually.
en-000003668	After completing his prison term in Egypt, Nawaz returned to the UK in 2006.
en-000003669	In 2007, he resigned from Hizb-ut-Tahrir and resumed his bachelors degree at SOAS.

en-000003676	However, the move proved to be futile as Robinson returned to the far-right in late 2015, joining the German-based organisation Pegida.
en-000003677	In his autobiography, Robinson claimed that Quilliam had paid him £2,000 per month in order to take credit for his resignation.
en-000003678	A Quilliam spokesperson responded by saying that Robinson was never on the organisation's payroll.
en-000003679	In 2011, Nawaz was approached by the publishing director of Ebury Publishing after a TED Talk.

en-000003681	He has co-founded an activist group in Pakistan, Khudi, using his knowledge of recruitment tactics in order to combat extremism.
en-000003682	In 2010, he wrote a series of articles for the Pakistani English daily "The Express Tribune" as part of this campaign.
en-000003683	In 2014 Nawaz received death threats after tweeting a Jesus and Mo cartoon alluding to the prophet Muhammed.
en-000003684	Petition organisers denied a connection to its alleged originator, Liberal Democrat member Mohammed Shafiq, and condemned the incitement to murder.

en-000003882	Leonora Cohen OBE (15 June 1873– 4 September 1978) was a British suffragette who was also an appointed OBE.
en-000003883	Lenora Cohen was born on 15 June 1873 to Canova and Jane Thorp.
en-000003884	Her widowed mother worked as a seamstress to provide for her family.
en-000003885	Henry was a childhood friend yet both of the families opposed of the marriage.
en-000003886	Cohen married for love but in the eyes of society, she had married up.
en-000003887	After their marriage in March 1900, the couple had their first child, Rosetta but she unfortunately died within the first year.
en-000003888	Two years later, she gave birth to her son Reginald who grew up healthy.
en-000003889	For the next nine years, the small family enjoyed a peaceful life as Henry's business as a jeweller flourished.
en-000003890	Cohen's life was full of events and people that motivated her to fight for women's right to vote.
en-000003891	Firstly, her mother Jane was a big influential factor in Cohen's life.
en-000003892	Later in life at an interview, Cohen stated that,"Life was hard.
en-000003893	My mother would say'Leonora, if only we women had a say in things', but we hadn't.
en-000003894	A drunken lout of a man...had a vote simply because he was a male.
en-000003895	This affected Cohen and her view of the treatment of women in the working world.
en-000003896	Also, Cohen's husband Henry, was very supportive of her passion to fight for women's rights.
en-000003897	Cohen's family and job experience all contributed to her desire to step up and take action as a suffragist.
en-000003898	Cohen made many physical actions of protest against the British government.
en-000003899	Cohen stood up for what she believed in by taking action and this can be seen repeatedly in history.
en-000003900	In 1909, she joined the Leeds Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).
en-000003901	The group intrigued Cohen because they believed in direct action to create change for women.
en-000003902	In 1911, Cohen joined in a protest where she took further action against the government.
en-000003903	Even though found guilty, she defended herself in court and the authorities released her.
en-000003904	Cohen received hate letters and her son faced persecution at school.
en-000003905	By 1923, Cohen became the first woman president of the Yorkshire Federation of Trades Councils.
en-000003906	Cohen's political action and rebellious deeds during protests did not go unnoticed.
en-000003907	Brian Harrison interviewed over 200 people, including Cohen, as a part of his project: Oral History of the Suffragette and Suffragist.
en-000003908	Her recollections of these moments in history were brought back into focus during the 70s.
en-000003909	The suffrage movement in the late nineteenth century was used as an example.
en-000003910	In the late nineteenth century, all powers raised their trade barriers – except Britain.
en-000003911	Therefore, they could spend more time pursuing interests outside of the home.
en-000003912	It is unclear if the suffragist's husbands were vegetarian as well.
en-000003913	Cohen's life is continually used as an example of early-day feminism and is often analysed.
en-000003914	At the time of her death, the Times newspaper published Cohen's passing in the obituary section.
en-000003915	The short column attempts to reflect on Cohen's life and highlight the extraordinary accomplishments in her 105 years spent on earth.
en-000003916	From her short obituary, Cohen was clearly remembered for the actions she took to defend the rights of women.
en-000003917	She was seen as a regional activist who was willing to die for the cause that she felt so passionately about.

en-000003968	8,000 US and other special operations forces make up the balance.
en-000003969	To manage this turmoil, over 40,000 foreign troops still occupy Afghanistan.
en-000003970	There is significant resistance, both from the ideological/theocratic Taliban, especially in southern Afghanistan, and also independent local warlords and drug organizations.
en-000003971	It is helpful to be aware of certain areas of Afghanistan, which play a role in the drug traffic.
en-000003972	See the role of "hawala" and Afghan drugs, and also the FININT section of CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities.
en-000003973	It must be emphasized that opium cultivation, on this scale, is not traditional.
en-000003974	During good years, Afghanistan produced enough food to feed its people as well as supply a surplus for export.
en-000003975	Its traditional agricultural products include wheat, corn, barley, rice, cotton, fruit, nuts, and grapes.
en-000003976	However, its agricultural economy has suffered considerably […] Afghanistan’s largest and fastest cash crop is opium."
en-000003977	Afghanistan's rugged terrain encourages local autonomy, which, in some cases, means local leadership committed to an opium economy.
en-000003978	Afghanistan’s economy has thus evolved to the point where it is now highly dependent on opium.
en-000003979	Even heftier profits are generated outside of Afghanistan by international drug traffickers and dealers.
en-000003980	Heroin processing labs have proliferated in Afghanistan since the late 1990s, particularly in the unstable southern region, further complicating stabilization efforts.
en-000003981	So why, with last year's bumper crop, is the opposite not occurring?
en-000003982	Early estimates suggest that opium cultivation is likely to increase again this year.
en-000003983	"Drug traffickers have a symbiotic relationship with insurgents and terrorist groups such as the Taliban and al-Qaeda.
en-000003984	If profits fall, these sinister forces have the most to lose.
en-000003985	As of October, 2009, the Taliban are supporting the opium trade and deriving funding from it.
en-000003986	Farmers routinely bribe police and counternarcotics eradication personnel to turn a blind eye.
en-000003987	Law enforcement personnel are also paid off by drug traffickers to ignore or, in some cases, protect their movements.
en-000003988	Again, that "hawala" handles and launders much of the funds involved make enforcement even more difficult.
en-000003989	UNODC's executive director believes these measures are insufficient:"What can be done?
en-000003990	"the consuming countries need to get serious about curbing drug addiction.
en-000003991	If there was less demand for heroin, the bottom really would fall out of the opium market."
en-000003992	Farmers economically dependent on opium must have viable alternatives that give sustainable income.
en-000003993	"Afghanistan's neighbors are either accomplices or victims in the opium trade, so they need to be part of the solution.
en-000003994	They could, for example, improve intelligence-sharing and border security to ensure that more opium is seized.
en-000003995	At the moment, less than a quarter of the world's opium is intercepted, compared with around half of global cocaine output."
en-000003996	This complicates, of course, the complex US relations with Pakistan and Iran.
en-000003997	There is an important nexus between drugs and "hawala" (informal money transfer system) in Afghanistan.
en-000003998	See informal money transfer systems to support clandestine activity, including terrorism, drug trade, and intelligence collection.
en-000003999	Different localities studied by the UNODC give different views of the laundering of drug funds.

en-000004001	Analysis of data gathered in places like Herat was complicated by confirmed links between drug money and legitimate imports.
en-000004002	Furthermore, Dubai appears to be a central clearing house for international hawala activities.

en-000004011	"The UNODC estimates 60 percent of Afghanistan’s opium is trafficked across Iran’s border (much of it in transit to Europe).
en-000004012	The Iranian government has gone through several phases in dealing with its drug problem.

en-000004014	"You have drug groups like guerrilla forces, [who]... shoot with rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, and Kalashnikovs."

en-000004017	Iran’s drug policy has been reconsidered and shifted back toward supply interdiction and boosting border security.

en-000004027	Ben'Ali in 1987 had constitutionally removed from office the former leader Habib Bourguiba (1903-2000, President 1957-1987).
en-000004028	The change in leadership "took place in complete calm" and the new regime inherited "a well-established party"nomenclatura "".
en-000004029	In 2004 Ben'Ali was reelected for a five-year term, with a reported 94.5% of the vote.
en-000004030	Elected also were 189 members of the "Majlis al-Nuwaab" or Chamber of Deputies, whose term was also five years.
en-000004031	The court system remained a combination of French Civil Law and Islamic law.
en-000004032	The autocratic rule of Ben'Ali was extended in 2009 by his reelection, reportedly at 99.44%.
en-000004033	Tunisia's political institutions, however, often appeared to remain fixed in an authoritarian past.
en-000004034	As reported in 2001, the government's response to calls for reform had been house arrests and prison.
en-000004035	The government refused to cease its repression of the Islamist opposition party, due to prior terrorist activity.
en-000004036	In foreign affairs, Tunisia continued its close ties to the West.
en-000004037	Following the 2001 al-Qaeda attacks on the United States, Tunisia stood with the west against terrorism.
en-000004038	Within the Maghreb, efforts continued to form a regional unity with Algeria, Morocco, Libya, and Mauritania]], in the Arab Maghreb Union.
en-000004039	Yet for Tunisia, "over 90 percent of its trade [was] with Europe, most of it with France."
en-000004040	Although many Tunisians disliked the regime's authoritarian repression, in compensation there was the government's ability to develop the country.
en-000004041	"Tunisia's strong economy throughout most of the Ben'Ali era helped to neutralize political opposition."
en-000004042	Yet under Ben'Ali, the modernizing privatization of state enterprises became corrupted at its root, benefitting insiders and family members.
en-000004043	Tunis, the capital city, had a population of about 700,000, out of Tunisia's total of nearly 10 million.
en-000004044	The second city of Sfax, a Mediterranean port to the south, a commercial and industrial center, numbered approximately 250,000.
en-000004045	The population growth rate measured as births per female had fallen from 7 (1960s) to 2 (2007).
en-000004046	The religion composition was: Muslim 98%, with 1% Christian, and 1% Jewish and other.
en-000004047	The official language continued as Arabic, with French also spoken particularly in commercial dealings, and with less than 2% Berber.
en-000004048	Literacy by recent definition included all over 15 years; overall it was 74%, male 83% and female 65%.
en-000004049	In 2006, 7.3 million mobile phones were in use and 1.3 million Tunisians were on the internet.
en-000004050	Over half the population was considered urban, with agricultural workers being about 30% of the total.
en-000004051	Unemployment in 2000 was about 15.6%, and in 2006 about 13.9%.
en-000004052	Over 300,000 Tunisians were reported to be residing in France during 1994.
en-000004053	Left out of the recent prosperity were many rural and urban poor, including small businesses facing the world market.
en-000004054	Other sectors included the petroleum industry and mining (phosphates, iron, lead, zinc, salt).
en-000004055	Exports in aggregate were sent to France 29%, Italy 20%, Germany 9%, Spain 6%, Libya 5%, U.S.A. 4%.
en-000004056	Imports arrived from France 25%, Italy 22%, Germany 10%, Spain 5%.
en-000004057	was composed of approximately 12.5% agriculture, 33.1% industry, and 54.4% services.
en-000004058	It regained a 5% rate for 2003–2005, and was said to be 4%-5% for 2006.
en-000004059	Tunisia's per capita annual income was approximately 8,900 U.S.A. dollars in 2006.
en-000004060	Annual per capita real income contracted 4.8%, on average, over the last six years.
en-000004061	The face of the countryside changes markedly as one moves from north to south.
en-000004062	In the north and central coast, orchards and fields predominate; while in the central plains, pasturage.
en-000004063	In the south the environment grows increasingly arid, until eventually reaching the Sahara desert borderlands.
en-000004064	Roads total about 20,000 km., two-thirds being paved, with most of the unpaved roads lying in the desert south.
en-000004065	The controversy began when the financial Panic of 1819 left many Kentuckians in debt and unable to meet their financial obligations.
en-000004066	A debt relief movement began in the state, and pro-relief candidates won majorities in the General Assembly in 1820.
en-000004067	More debt relief – encompassing more countries and more debt (including bilateral debt) – is needed.
en-000004068	The Assembly passed a law of "replevin" that was extremely favorable to debtors.
en-000004069	Disgruntled creditors challenged the constitutionality of the law, appealing their case to the Court of Appeals.
en-000004070	They abolished the New Court and restored the Old Court to power.
en-000004071	In an 1829 case, the Court nullified decisions rendered by the New Court.
en-000004072	In a 1935 case, the Court struck all the New Court cases from Kentucky common law.
en-000004073	A period of national prosperity followed the end of the War of 1812.
en-000004074	In Kentucky, rapid population growth and strong demand for the state's goods led to land speculation becoming a popular enterprise.
en-000004075	The charter of the Kentucky Insurance Company in 1802 and the Bank of Kentucky in 1806 made currency for loans plentiful.
en-000004076	In 1818, the General Assembly chartered 40 more state banks, and later added six more.
en-000004077	In late 1818, however, demand for U.S. goods fell sharply in Europe.
en-000004078	Land values also began to fall, touching off the Panic of 1819.
en-000004079	Many persons in the state were unable to repay their loans.
en-000004080	A Debt Relief Party sprang up in the state, which had long been a single-party bastion.
en-000004081	He concurred when the General Assembly abolished damages on disputed bills of exchange.
en-000004082	In 1820, the Debt Relief Party gained majorities in both houses of the General Assembly.
en-000004083	They hoped that this would provide time for an economic recovery which would allow debtors to save their investments.
en-000004084	On November 29, 1820, the Assembly chartered the Bank of the Commonwealth, another source from which debtors could obtain money.
en-000004085	By 1821, the Relief Party had successfully ended the practice of debt imprisonment in Kentucky.
en-000004086	Fayette County circuit court judge Francis P. Blair issued a similar ruling in the case of "Lapsley v. Brashear".
en-000004087	Both cases were appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals—then the highest court in Kentucky—in 1823.
en-000004088	His efforts drew a resolution against him from the anti-relief minority on November 8, 1823.
en-000004089	Desha's election by the overwhelming vote of 38,378–22,499 was seen by the party as a mandate to pursue the relief agenda.
en-000004090	The justices were spared removal when the Senate failed to pass the measure with a two-thirds majority.
en-000004091	During the debate, Governor Desha personally lobbied legislators to support the measure, a blatant violation of the rules of the House.
en-000004092	The next day the measure passed in the House by a vote of 54–43.
en-000004093	Governor Desha appointed pro-relief stalwart William T. Barry as Chief Justice, and three associate justices who were also Relief Party supporters.
en-000004094	The existing court and the anti-relief party refused to recognize the new court as valid.
en-000004095	Francis Blair, the New Court clerk, assembled a group that broke into Sneed's office and took what records they could find.
en-000004096	Sneed was charged with contempt of court and fined for refusing to turn over the records.
en-000004097	In the elections of 1825, the Old Court supporters won control of the Kentucky House of Representatives.
en-000004098	On November 23, Old Court supporters introduced a bill to repeal the reorganization act.
en-000004099	By 1826, economic prosperity was beginning to return to the state.
en-000004100	The Old Court party augmented their majority in the House and gained a majority in the Senate.
en-000004101	Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure.
en-000004102	They also repealed the replevin law that had touched off the controversy.
en-000004103	On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.
en-000004104	Old Court chief justice John Boyle resigned to accept a federal judgeship.
en-000004105	Old Court justices Mills and Owsley resigned, hoping to clarify the situation further.
en-000004106	They were immediately reappointed, but the Senate refused to confirm their appointments.
en-000004107	The governor appointed George Robertson and Joseph R. Underwood, who were both confirmed by the Senate.
en-000004108	In all, the New Court heard 77 cases during the Old Court– New Court controversy.
en-000004109	Blankenese has a long history as a fishing village along the Elbe River.
en-000004110	In 1060, Archbishop Adalbert of Bremen built a provost's residence at the site of an older settlement at the hill Süllberg.
en-000004111	Until 1927 Blankenese was an independent town in Holstein and then it was merged into the town Altona by law.
en-000004112	In 1938 Altona was merged into Hamburg with the Greater Hamburg Act.
en-000004113	Nowadays, it is regarded as one of Germany's most affluent neighborhoods.
en-000004114	Blankenese comes from the Low German "blank ness", meaning "white promontory" in the Elbe river.
en-000004115	Blankenese is located south of Sülldorf, east of Rissen and west of Nienstedten.
en-000004116	The stunning views from the river-facing portions of Blankenese have resulted in highly desirable properties and expensive real estate prices.
en-000004117	In Romania, real-estate prices rose 23% annually from 2004 to 2007.
en-000004118	The steep hillside residences boast many tiny, pedestrian-only streets and 4,864 stairs.
en-000004119	The Strandweg is home to the Strand Hotel, built in 1902, as well as several other cafes and restaurants.
en-000004120	There are two lighthouses, a Roman garden, a doll museum and many parks and walking trails in Blankenese.
en-000004121	There are 4 elementary schools and 4 secondary schools: "Marion Dönhoff Gymnasium", "Gymnasium Blankenese", "Bugenhagenschule am Hessepark" and "Gesamtschule Blankenese".
en-000004122	A local office of the main district office Altona called Customer Centre Blankenese is located at "Sülldorfer Kirchenweg 2".
en-000004123	Blankeneser Landstrasse and Blankenese Bahnhofstrasse form the main intersection of commercial activities in Bankenese.
en-000004124	The hospital "Tabea GmbH", located at "Kösterbergstrasse", has 32 beds and specializes on hip and knee surgery and varicose vein surgery.
en-000004125	According to the Department of Motor Vehicles (Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt), there were 6,333 private cars registered (486 cars/1000 people).
en-000004126	In summer 2008, the main train station in Blankenese has been completely rebuilt.
en-000004127	Blankenese's waterfront is serviced many times a day by various water shuttles.
en-000004128	Both form a line together to Elbe River for incoming ships.
en-000004129	The hulls of the following two sunken vessels are located outside the main international shipping strait.
en-000004130	They had been earmarked for removal as they may pose a hazard to recreational marine traffic.
en-000004131	However they afford scenic views and are popular with the locals, hence were allowed to remain there:
en-000004132	UTM coordinates: 5934830.59 N, 552083.28 E The wreck can be reached at low tide without getting your feet wet.
en-000004133	Its cargo of wood caught fire when an engine exploded while passing Kaiser Wilhelm Canal (today's Kiel Canal).
en-000004134	She was then, a few days later, towed to "Blankenese", where she was temporarily moored.
en-000004135	Her insurers disputed responsibility for the wreck and it remained lying there ever since.
en-000004136	Blankense has its own website which posts recent pictures and news events for its residents.
en-000004137	The Soviets had ceased to recognise the Polish state at the start of the invasion.
en-000004138	Since 1939 German and Soviet officials coordinated their Poland-related policies and repressive actions.
en-000004139	There is some controversy as to whether the Soviet Union's policies were harsher than those of Nazi Germany until that time.
en-000004140	It is estimated that at least 150,000 Polish citizens died during the Soviet occupation.
en-000004141	It is a conservative estimate confirmed by analysis, while the unconfirmed number proposed by Prof. Czesław Łuczak reaches 500,000.
en-000004142	There were also 336,000 refugees from areas occupied by Germany, most of them Jews (198,000).
en-000004143	On 28 September 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany had changed the secret terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
en-000004144	The demarcation line across the centre of Poland was shifted to the east, giving Germany more Polish territory.
en-000004145	The area amounted to about 200,000 square kilometres, which was inhabited by 13.5 million formerly Polish citizens.
en-000004146	Initially, the Soviet occupation gained support among some citizens of the Second Polish Republic who were not ethnically Polish.
en-000004147	Some members of the Ukrainian population welcomed the unification with the Soviet Ukraine.
en-000004148	Many of them committed treason against the Polish state by assisting in round ups and executions of Polish officials.
en-000004149	Their enthusiasm however faded with time as it became clear that the Soviet repressions were aimed at all peoples equally.
en-000004150	As the Soviet Union had not signed international conventions on rules of war, the Polish prisoners were denied legal status.
en-000004151	The Soviet forces murdered almost all captured officers, and sent numerous ordinary soldiers to the Soviet Gulag.
en-000004152	Among the 14,471 victims were top Polish Army officers, including political leaders, government officials, and intellectuals.
en-000004153	In total, the Soviets killed tens of thousands of Polish prisoners of war.
en-000004154	Many of them, like General Józef Olszyna-Wilczyński, captured, interrogated and shot on 22 September, were killed during the 1939 campaign.
en-000004155	The Soviets also executed all the Polish officers they captured after the Battle of Szack, on 28 September.
en-000004156	Those arrested included Władysław Broniewski, Aleksander Wat, Tadeusz Peiper, Leopold Lewin, Anatol Stern, Teodor Parnicki, Marian Czuchnowski and many others.
en-000004157	The Soviet NKVD executed about 65,000 imprisoned Poles after kangaroo trials.
en-000004158	The number of Poles who died due to Soviet repressions in the period 1939-1941 is estimated as at least 150,000.
en-000004159	Approximately 100,000 Polish citizens were arrested during the two years of Soviet occupation.
en-000004160	The prisons soon got severely overcrowded, with all detainees accused of anti-Soviet activities.
en-000004161	The NKVD had to open dozens of ad-hoc prison sites in almost all towns of the region.
en-000004162	Altogether the Soviets sent roughly a million people from Poland to Siberia.
en-000004163	In 2006, around 150 million migrants sent roughly $300 billion to their families in developing countries.
en-000004164	Singapore is a city-state of five million people – roughly the population of the Haidian district of Beijing.
en-000004165	According to Norman Davies, almost half had died by the time the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement had been signed in 1941.
en-000004166	Around 55% of the deportees to Siberia and Soviet Central Asia were Polish women.
en-000004167	The first major operation took place on February 10, 1940, with more than 220,000 people sent to northern European Russia.
en-000004168	The second wave of 13 April 1940, consisted of 320,000 people sent primarily to Kazakhstan.
en-000004169	The fourth and final wave occurred in June 1941, deporting 300,000.
en-000004170	But, actual conferral of citizenship required individual consent and residents were strongly pressured for such consent.
en-000004171	Those refugees who opted out were threatened with repatriation to German-controlled territories of Poland.
en-000004172	The Soviets lobbied the Western Allies to recognize the pro-Soviet Polish puppet government of Wanda Wasilewska in Moscow.
en-000004173	The Red Army had sown confusion among the locals by claiming that they were arriving to save Poland from the Nazis.
en-000004174	Their advance surprised Polish communities and their leaders, who had not been advised how to respond to a Bolshevik invasion.
en-000004175	They began confiscating, nationalising and redistributing all private and state-owned Polish property.
en-000004176	While Germans enforced their policies based on racism, the Soviet administration justified their Stalinist policies by appealing to Soviet ideology.
en-000004177	Immediately after their conquest of eastern Poland, the Soviet authorities started a campaign of sovietization of the newly acquired areas.
en-000004178	The result of the staged voting was to legitimize the Soviet annexation of eastern Poland.
en-000004179	Subsequently, all institutions of the dismantled Polish state were closed down and reopened under the Soviet-appointed supervisors.
en-000004180	Lwów University was reorganized in accordance with the Statute Books for Soviet Higher Schools.
en-000004181	The Soviets established several new chairs, particularly the chairs of Russian language and literature.
en-000004182	The chairs of Marxism-Leninism, and Dialectical and Historical Materialism, aimed at strengthening Soviet ideology, were opened as well.
en-000004183	Forty-five new faculty members were assigned to Lwów, transferred from other institutions of Soviet Ukraine, mainly the Kharkiv and Kiev universities.
en-000004184	On January 15, 1940 the Lwów University was reopened; its professors started to teach in accordance with Soviet curricula.
en-000004185	Soviet authorities implemented a political regime similar to police state, based on terror.
en-000004186	Only the Communist Party was allowed to exist, with organizations subordinated to it.
en-000004187	All enterprises were taken over by the state, while agriculture was made collective.
en-000004188	Pre-war Poland was portrayed as a capitalist state based on exploitation of the working people and ethnic minorities.
en-000004189	Soviet propaganda claimed that the unfair treatment of non-Poles by the Second Polish Republic justified its dismemberment.
en-000004190	The death toll of the initial Soviet-inspired terror campaign remains unknown.
en-000004191	About 600 people died as the result of the Augustów roundup.
en-000004192	To this day the events of those and the following years constitute stumbling blocks in Polish-Russian foreign relations.
en-000004193	Polish requests for the return of looted property or for an apology for Soviet-era crimes are either ignored or rejected.
en-000004194	The Soviet and Russian state remind the nation of their version of history: "we freed you from Nazism: be grateful."
en-000004195	Ramón Rodríguez Chacín (born November 9, 1951) is a Venezuelan politician.
en-000004196	A retired naval officer, he was Minister of the Interior and Justice in 2002, and again in 2008.
en-000004197	Rodríguez Chacín specialized in counter-insurgency and counter-intelligence tactics while serving in the military of Venezuela.
en-000004198	Rodríguez Chacín was jailed and served two years on charges of treason and rebellion.
en-000004199	With the election of Hugo Chávez as president of Venezuela in 1999, Rodríguez Chacín worked as his intelligence chief.
en-000004200	Rodriguez Chacín was Minister of the Interior in 2002 (from January), being replaced in May 2002 by Diosdado Cabello.
en-000004201	In January 2008 another liberation of four Colombian hostages by the FARC was managed by Rodríguez Chacín.
en-000004202	Rodriguez Chacín was appointed Minister of the Interior for a second time in January 2008, replacing Pedro Carreño.
en-000004203	The source for these documents was allegedly a 2008 cross-border raid by Colombian military into Ecuador which destroyed a FARC camp.
en-000004204	This makes China the source of cross-border water flows to the largest number of countries in the world.
en-000004205	They are false, and an attempt to discredit the Venezuelan government."
en-000004206	The government in Cyprus considers that the "bilateral relations between Cyprus and Norway are excellent in all fields".
en-000004207	Norway is represented in Cyprus through its embassy in Athens, Greece, and an honorary consulate in Nicosia.
en-000004208	On 7 April 1998, Svein Ole Sæther became the non-resident Norwegian Ambassador to Cyprus stationed in Tel Aviv.
en-000004209	He said "[bilateral relations] have been enhanced over the last years, not at least due to tourism."
en-000004210	On 21 August 1951, there was a Consular Convention and an Exchange of Letters relating to establishing diplomatic relations.
en-000004211	First, the US should consider establishing diplomatic relations with Iran and putting diplomats on the ground.
en-000004212	On 17 May 1962, there was an Exchange of Letters constituting an Agreement on the Abolition of Visa Requirement in Nicosia.
en-000004213	On 5 March 1963, there was an Agreement on Commercial Scheduled Air Transport signed in London.
en-000004214	The taxation levels in Cyprus are considerably lower than in Norway, and Cyprus has actively courted Norwegians to move to Cyprus.
en-000004215	Among the Norwegians who moved to Cyprus is the shipping billionaire John Fredriksen, who was the richest man in Norway.
en-000004216	Diplomatic relations between Switzerland and the People's Republic of China (proclaimed on 1 October 1949) were established on 17 January 1950.
en-000004217	Sino-Swiss economic relations have accelerated since Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms in the late 1970s.
en-000004218	Switzerland's trade with China is not in deficit as other industrialized nations trade with China.
en-000004219	Two way trade between the two countries is growing at an annual rate of 20–30 percent.
en-000004220	India is growing at an annual rate of around 9%; China at around 10%.
en-000004221	In 2007, Swiss exports were valued at 5.4 billion Swiss francs or 5.36 billion US dollars.
en-000004222	China is now Switzerland's top trading partner in Asia, ahead of Japan.
en-000004223	Swiss firms have been investing in China substantially over the last decade.
en-000004224	There are approximately 300 Swiss firms with more than 700 branches operating in China with a total employment of 55,000 people.
en-000004225	Chinese firms have a small but growing presence in Switzerland as a base to expand in Europe.
en-000004226	Switzerland thus became the first continental European country and the largest economy to conclude a free trade deal with China.
en-000004227	The name of the station was Ürümqi Railway Station from 1962 until September 1, 2014.
en-000004228	This name is now assigned to the newly built high-speed railway station of the Lanzhou–Ürümqi High-Speed Railway.
en-000004229	On 30 April 2014, a terrorist attack occurred at the station, which left three people dead and 79 injured.
en-000004230	Terrorist attacks have occurred subsequently in Indonesia, Madrid, London, Egypt, and most recently Mumbai.
en-000004231	Donald Peter Macdonald (3 August 1886– 3 November 1962) was an Australian politician and clergyman.
en-000004232	He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly between 1941 and 1947 and an Independent member of parliament.
en-000004233	McDonald was born in London and was the son of a stockbroker.
en-000004234	He had one son, Roderick, who was a war correspondent killed at the Battle of Monte Cassino and two daughters.
en-000004235	After leaving parliament, Macdonald retired to a farm in the Mudgee area.
en-000004236	He had a number of books published in 1909, 1915 and 1930.
en-000004237	He entered parliament as the Independent UAP member for Mosman after winning the seat at the 1941 state election.
en-000004238	In parliament, Macdonald campaigned for the state government to take a loan of ₤ 5,000,000 to revamp the public school system.
en-000004239	He also called for education reforms including daily prayers and a ban on caning.
en-000004240	In that year he co-founded the Political Reform League with another independent James Shand, the member for Ryde.
en-000004241	This was intended to be the basis of a new centrist party in NSW but failed to attract public support.
en-000004242	The new German political party would attract much more support, and sentiment might shift.
en-000004243	Macdonald was defeated by the official Liberal Party candidate Pat Morton at the next election in 1947.
en-000004244	It was a member of the financial group Konversbank and was listed on the NASDAQ OMX Vilnius stock exchange.
en-000004245	Bankas Snoras AB was founded 1992 as a regional bank of Šiauliai and renamed to its current name in 1993.
en-000004246	It was recognised as the best bank in Lithuania in 2006 by financial publisher "The Banker".
en-000004247	The check also revealed that the bank has ignored the central bank's recommendation to reduce operating risks.
en-000004248	There are no policies to reduce risks in shadow banks, insurance companies, or mutual funds.
en-000004249	Major shareholders, holding more than 5% of the shares of the company were:
en-000004250	Snoras AB has invested in a variety of business, most notable are:
en-000004251	In 2008, SNORAS purchased 29.8% of shares of Dutch sport car manufacturer Spyker Cars.
en-000004252	In the same year, SNORAS sold the stake in Spyker Cars.
en-000004253	Hubert Pilčík was born on October 14, 1891 in Nový Hrozenkov, Vsetín District in what is now the Czech Republic.
en-000004254	He went from job to job, ending up in the Škoda factory in Plzeň, where he remained until his retirement.
en-000004255	After the communist party came to power in 1948, up to 250,000 people emigrated from Czechoslovakia.
en-000004256	Both the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army could survive without US patronage.
en-000004257	Many people used the services of human smugglers to go to Germany or Austria.
en-000004258	On the evening of March 6, 1951, a fire broke out in an abandoned forestry cottage called "Lipovka".
en-000004259	On July 20, children playing in sand near the city of Senec found a human leg.
en-000004260	This led to the discovery of a shallow grave containing the decaying remains of a young woman.
en-000004261	Through a specific dental work, the victim was identified as Renata Balleyova, a photographer from Pilsen.
en-000004262	Interviews with relatives determined that Renata and her father Emanuel were intending to defect from Czechoslovakia.
en-000004263	One of her relatives provided letters from Bavaria which "proved" that Renata, Emanuel, and his 12-year-old niece were in Germany.
en-000004264	Soon, the investigators focused on Hubert Pilčík, then a retiree with a good reputation.
en-000004265	They found four firearms and numerous items in suitcases (from various victims); they also rescued Emanuel's 12-year-old niece.
en-000004266	The girl was held there for most of the day and was regularly raped.
en-000004267	He then delivered the letters and demanded payment for this service in jewellery.
en-000004268	Pilčík killed Emanuel in his sleep at "Lipovka", while the man waited to be smuggled to Bavaria.
en-000004269	Renata, also planning to defect, was killed less than two weeks later, near Senec.
en-000004270	In his confession, Pilčík stated that he had planned to kill Emanuel's niece, as well as another relative and his wife.
en-000004271	However, by that time, he had been imprisoned, and committed suicide using two handkerchiefs.
en-000004272	RBC theory differs in this way from other theories of the business cycle such as Keynesian economics and monetarism.
en-000004273	America’s economic contradictions are part of a new business cycle that has emerged since 1980.
en-000004274	RBC theory is associated with freshwater economics (the Chicago School of Economics in the neoclassical tradition).
en-000004275	If we were to take snapshots of an economy at different points in time, no two photos would look alike.
en-000004276	This is just the value of the goods and services produced by a country’s businesses and workers.
en-000004277	Figure 1 shows the time series of real GNP for the United States from 1954–2005.
en-000004278	While we see continuous growth of output, it is not a steady increase.
en-000004279	There are times of faster growth and times of slower growth.
en-000004280	Figure 2 transforms these levels into growth rates of real GNP and extracts a smoother growth trend.
en-000004281	A common method to obtain this trend is the Hodrick–Prescott filter.
en-000004282	Observe the difference between this growth component and the jerkier data.
en-000004283	Economists refer to these cyclical movements about the trend as business cycles.
en-000004284	A point on this line indicates at that year, there is no deviation from the trend.
en-000004285	We call large positive deviations (those above the 0 axis) peaks.
en-000004286	We call relatively large negative deviations (those below the 0 axis) troughs.
en-000004287	A series of positive deviations leading to peaks are booms and a series of negative deviations leading to troughs are recessions.
en-000004288	At a glance, the deviations just look like a string of waves bunched together—nothing about it appears consistent.
en-000004289	To explain causes of such fluctuations may appear rather difficult given these irregularities.
en-000004290	However, if we consider other macroeconomic variables, we will observe patterns in these irregularities.
en-000004291	For example, consider Figure 4 which depicts fluctuations in output and consumption spending, i.e.
en-000004292	Observe how the peaks and troughs align at almost the same places and how the upturns and downturns coincide.
en-000004293	We might predict that other similar data may exhibit similar qualities.
en-000004294	While Figure 5 shows a similar story for investment, the relationship with capital in Figure 6 departs from the story.
en-000004295	We need a way to pin down a better story; one way is to look at some statistics.
en-000004296	By eyeballing the data, we can infer several regularities, sometimes called stylized facts.
en-000004297	Column A of Table 1 lists a measure of this with standard deviations.
en-000004298	The magnitude of fluctuations in output and hours worked are nearly equal.
en-000004299	Consumption and productivity are similarly much smoother than output while investment fluctuates much more than output.
en-000004300	Yet another regularity is the co-movement between output and the other macroeconomic variables.
en-000004301	We can measure this in more detail using correlations as listed in column B of Table 1.
en-000004302	Procyclical variables have positive correlations since it usually increases during booms and decreases during recessions.
en-000004303	Acyclical, correlations close to zero, implies no systematic relationship to the business cycle.
en-000004304	This implies workers and capital are more productive when the economy is experiencing a boom.
en-000004305	They aren’t quite as productive when the economy is experiencing a slowdown.
en-000004306	Similar explanations follow for consumption and investment, which are strongly procyclical.
en-000004307	Observing these similarities yet seemingly non-deterministic fluctuations about trend, we come to the burning question of why any of this occurs.
en-000004308	So the key question really is: "what main factor influences and subsequently changes the decisions of all factors in an economy?"
en-000004309	Economists have come up with many ideas to answer the above question.
en-000004310	Examples of such shocks include innovations, bad weather, imported oil price increase, stricter environmental and safety regulations, etc.
en-000004311	The general gist is that something occurs that directly changes the effectiveness of capital and/or labour.
en-000004312	RBC models predict time sequences of allocation for consumption, investment, etc.
en-000004313	But exactly how do these productivity shocks cause ups and downs in economic activity?
en-000004314	This momentarily increases the effectiveness of workers and capital, allowing a given level of capital and labor to produce more output.
en-000004315	But if he values future consumption, all that extra output might not be worth consuming in its entirety today.
en-000004316	They will thus save (and invest) in periods of high income and defer consumption of this to periods of low income.
en-000004317	Higher productivity encourages substitution of current work for future work since workers will earn more per hour today compared to tomorrow.
en-000004318	However, given the pro-cyclical nature of labor, it seems that the above“substitution effect” dominates this“income effect”.
en-000004319	That is, above-trend behavior may persist for some time even after the shock disappears.
en-000004320	It is easy to see that a string of such productivity shocks will likely result in a boom.
en-000004321	Similarly, recessions follow a string of bad shocks to the economy.
en-000004322	If there were no shocks, the economy would just continue following the growth trend with no business cycles.
en-000004323	Essentially this is how the basic RBC model qualitatively explains key business cycle regularities.
en-000004324	Yet any good model should also generate business cycles that quantitatively match the stylized facts in Table 1, our empirical benchmark.
en-000004325	Yet current RBC models have not fully explained all behavior and neoclassical economists are still searching for better variations.
en-000004326	It is important to note the main assumption in RBC theory is that individuals and firms respond optimally all the time.
en-000004327	It follows that business cycles exhibited in an economy are chosen in preference to no business cycles at all.
en-000004328	This is not to say that people like to be in a recession.
en-000004329	Slumps are preceded by an undesirable productivity shock which constrains the situation.
en-000004330	But given these new constraints, people will still achieve the best outcomes possible and markets will react efficiently.
en-000004331	A precursor to RBC theory was developed by monetary economists Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas in the early 1970s.
en-000004332	In a world of perfect information, there would be no booms or recessions.
en-000004333	In fact, simply stated, it is the process of changing the model to fit the data.
en-000004334	These tend to be estimated from econometric studies, with 95% confidence intervals.
en-000004335	The model is driven by large and sudden changes in available production technology.
en-000004336	Another major criticism is that real business cycle models can not account for the dynamics displayed by U.S. gross national product.
en-000004337	CHCs are organized as non-profit clinical care providers that operate under comprehensive federal standards.
en-000004338	To receive Section 330 grant funds, CHCs must meet the following qualifications:
en-000004339	Uniquely in community health centers, at least 51% of all governing board members must be patients there.
en-000004340	A sliding fee scale based on income is implemented to decrease the cost of care.
en-000004341	The purpose of these stipulations is to ensure that health centers improve access to care and serve the community.
en-000004342	Aid for health care works – and works magnificently – to save and improve lives.
en-000004343	Administrative and health care personnel meet regularly to focus on location health care needs.
en-000004344	The mission of community health centers depends on collaborative relationships with industry, government, hospitals and other health services.
en-000004345	There are now more than 1,250 federally supported FQHCs with more than 8,000 service delivery sites.
en-000004346	In 1915, the system expanded, adding four district centers in Queens.
en-000004347	The official establishment of community health centers was caused by the civil rights movement of the 1960s.
en-000004348	The Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) established what was initially called“neighborhood health centers” as a War on Poverty demonstration program.
en-000004349	The aim of these clinics was to provide access points to health and social services to medically under-served and disenfranchised populations.
en-000004350	The health centers were intended to serve as a mechanism for community empowerment.
en-000004351	Accordingly, federal funds for the clinics went directly to nonprofit, community-level organizations.
en-000004352	The health centers were designed and run with extensive community involvement to ensure that they remained responsive to community needs.
en-000004353	On its twenty-fifth anniversary in 1990, the center was rededicated as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center and is still in operation.
en-000004354	This center was also set up in conjunction with Tufts University with a grant from the OEO.
en-000004355	While the Columbia Point Health Center was set in an urban community, the Delta Health Center represented a rural model.
en-000004356	The War on Poverty enlisted many idealistic men, such as Leon Kruger, the first Director of the CHC at Mound Bayou.
en-000004357	As a result, many families such as his, were drafted in the War on Poverty, often at their own risk.
en-000004358	In the early 1970s, the health centers program was transferred to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).
en-000004359	The HEW has since become the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
en-000004360	Within HHS, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) currently administers the program.
en-000004361	Community health centers primarily provide health care to patients who are uninsured or covered by Medicaid.
en-000004362	In 2007, almost 40% of all CHC patients lacked insurance, and 35% were Medicaid patients.
en-000004363	The people affected most by this scarcity in services are the uninsured and Medicaid patients.
en-000004364	In 2008, 1,080 CHCs provided comprehensive primary care to more than 17.1 million people.
en-000004365	CHC patients typically have low family incomes, live in medically under-served communities, and have complicated health conditions.
en-000004366	In 2007, half of all CHC patients were minorities, a third of whom were Hispanic.
en-000004367	CHC patients are more likely to reside in rural areas relative to the rest of the population.
en-000004368	They tend to be younger in age and are more likely to be female.
en-000004369	In 2008, 36% of all CHC patients were children, and almost three in five patients were female.
en-000004370	The sources of funding for health centers have changed significantly over time.
en-000004371	Public Health Service Act grants under Section 330 were once a prominent source of funding for CHCs.
en-000004372	In 2008, Public Health Service Act grants comprised 18.3% of all CHC revenues.
en-000004373	In 1985, Medicaid patients made up 28% of all CHC patients but only 15% of CHC revenues.
en-000004374	By 2007, the share of Medicaid patients matched their share of revenues.
en-000004375	In the same time period, grants for the uninsured decreased from 51% to 21%.
en-000004376	In 2008, Medicaid payments had grown to account for 37% of all CHC revenues.
en-000004377	Medicaid’s shift to a managed care delivery system in the 1990s required CHCs to again modify their financial structure.
en-000004378	Health centers largely lost money in their early experiences of contracting and assuming risk for Medicaid managed care patients.
en-000004379	The economic recession in the United States continues to pose significant challenges for community health centers.
en-000004380	In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) appropriated $2 billion for investment in health center expansion.
en-000004381	By 2010, assisted by funding received through the ARRA, health centers had expanded to serve more than 18 million people.
en-000004382	In France the revolutionary events ended the Orleans monarchy (1830–48) and led to the creation of the French Second Republic.
en-000004383	Following the overthrow of King Louis Philippe in February, the elected government of the Second Republic ruled France.
en-000004384	In the months that followed, this government steered a course that became more conservative.
en-000004385	On 2 December 1848, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was elected President of the Second Republic, largely on peasant support.
en-000004386	Exactly four years later he suspended the elected assembly, establishing the Second French Empire, which lasted until 1870.
en-000004387	Louis Napoléon would go on to become the de facto last French monarch.
en-000004388	These tensions between liberal Orleanist and Radical Republicans and Socialists led to the June Days Uprising.
en-000004389	Under the Charter of 1814, Louis XVIII ruled France as the head of a constitutional monarchy.
en-000004390	Upon Louis XVIII's death, his brother, the Count of Artois, ascended to the throne in 1825, as Charles X.
en-000004391	These ordinances abolished freedom of the press, reduced the electorate by 75%, and dissolved the lower house.
en-000004392	Charles was forced to abdicate the throne and to flee Paris for the United Kingdom.
en-000004393	Nicknamed the "Bourgeois Monarch", Louis Philippe sat at the head of a moderately liberal state controlled mainly by educated elites.
en-000004394	Still Louis Philippe saw himself as the successful embodiment of a "small businessman" ("petite bourgeoisie").
en-000004395	Accordingly, during the reign of Louis Philippe, the privileged "financial aristocracy,""i.e".
en-000004396	Naturally, land-ownership was favoured, and this elitism resulted in the disenfranchisement of much of the middle and working classes.
en-000004397	By 1848 only about one percent of the population held the franchise.
en-000004398	Early in 1848, some Orleanist liberals, such as Adolphe Thiers, had turned against him, disappointed by Louis Philippe's opposition to parliamentarism.
en-000004399	The more radical democrats of the Reform Movement coalesced around the newspaper, "La Réforme".
en-000004400	Workers lost their jobs, bread prices rose, people accused the government of corruption.
en-000004401	Alexis de Tocqueville had observed,"We are sleeping together in a volcano.
en-000004402	... A wind of revolution blows, the storm is on the horizon."
en-000004403	Lacking the property qualifications to vote, the lower classes were about to erupt in revolt.
en-000004404	Meanwhile, economically, the working class may perhaps have been slightly better off than Britain's working class.
en-000004405	Still, unemployment in France threw skilled workers down to the level of the proletariat.
en-000004406	The only nominally social law of the July Monarchy was passed in 1841.
en-000004407	The year 1846 saw a financial crisis and bad harvests, and the following year saw an economic depression.
en-000004408	A poor railroad system hindered aid efforts, and the Peasant rebellions that resulted were forcefully crushed.
en-000004409	"Dangerous " writers proliferated such as Louis Blanc ("The right to work ") and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon ("Property is theft!").
en-000004410	Friedrich Engels was in Paris dating from October 1847 and was able to observe and attend some of these banquets.
en-000004411	The banquet campaign lasted until all political banquets were outlawed by the French government in February 1848.
en-000004412	Shouting "Down with Guizot" ("À bas Guizot ") and"Long Live the Reform " ("Vive la réforme") the crowds marched past Guizot's residence.
en-000004413	The crowds erected barricades in the streets of Paris, and fighting broke out between the citizens and the Parisian municipal guards.
en-000004414	At 2pm the next day, 23 February, Prime Minister Guizot resigned.
en-000004415	Upon hearing the news of Guizot's resignation, a large crowd gathered outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
en-000004416	The officer ordered his men to fix bayonets, probably wishing to avoid shooting.
en-000004417	Omnibuses were turned into barricades, and thousands of trees were felled.
en-000004418	Fires were set, and angry citizens began converging to the royal palace.
en-000004419	On 26 February 1848, the liberal opposition came together to organize a provisional government, called the Second Republic.
en-000004420	The poet Alphonse de Lamartine was appointed president of the provisional government.
en-000004421	Lamartine served as a virtual dictator of France for the next three months.
en-000004422	Elections for a Constituent Assembly were scheduled for 23 April 1848.
en-000004423	The Constituent Assembly was to establish a new republican government for France.
en-000004424	In preparation for these elections, two major goals of the provisional government were universal suffrage and unemployment relief.
en-000004425	Universal male suffrage was enacted on 2 March 1848, giving France nine million new voters.
en-000004426	As in all other European nations, women did not have the right to vote.
en-000004427	However, during this time a proliferation of political clubs emerged, including women's organizations.
en-000004428	By May 1848 the National Workshops were employing 100,000 workers and paying out daily wages of 70,000 livres.
en-000004429	On May 31, 15,000 jobless French rioted as rising xenophobia persecuted Belgian workers in the north.
en-000004430	There was a corresponding decline in the luxury trade and credit became expensive.
en-000004431	Naturally, the provisional government was disorganized as it attempted to deal with France's economic problems.
en-000004432	The conservative elements of French society were wasting no time in organizing against the provisional government.
en-000004433	Additionally, there was a major split between the citizens of Paris and those citizens of the more rural areas of France.
en-000004434	The provisional government set out to establish deeper government control of the economy and guarantee a more equal distribution of resources.
en-000004435	As noted above, to deal with the unemployment problem, the provisional government established National Workshops.
en-000004436	The unemployed were given jobs building roads and planting trees without regard for the demand for these tasks.
en-000004437	To pay for these the new National Workshops and the other social programs, the provisional government placed new taxes on land.
en-000004438	These taxes alienated the "landed classes"—especially the small farmers and the peasantry of the rural areas of France—from the provisional government.
en-000004439	Hardworking rural farmers were resistant to paying for the unemployed city people and their new "Right to Work" National Workshops.
en-000004440	The taxes were widely disobeyed in the rural areas and, thus, the government remained strapped for cash.
en-000004441	Popular uncertainty about the liberal foundations of the provisional government became apparent in the 23 April 1848 elections.
en-000004442	Despite the agitation from the left, voters elected a constituent assembly which was primarily moderate and conservative.
en-000004443	Many radicals felt the elections were a sign of the slowing down of the revolutionary movement.
en-000004444	These radicals in Paris pressured the government to head an international "crusade" for democracy.
en-000004445	Independence of other European states, such as Poland was urged by the Paris radicals.
en-000004446	The nation of Poland had been gradually "partitioned" or divided between foreign powers of Prussia, Russia, and Austria in 1773, 1793.
en-000004447	Finally in 1795, all of the Polish nation was swallowed up by the three powers.
en-000004448	However, the government of the National Constituent Assembly continued to resist the radicals.
en-000004449	The radicals began to protest against the National Constituent Assembly government.
en-000004450	This attempted revolution on the part of the working classes was quickly suppressed by the National Guard.
en-000004451	The leaders of this revolt—Louis Auguste Blanqui, Armand Barbès, François Vincent Raspail and others—were arrested.
en-000004452	The trial of these leaders was held in Bourges, France, from March 7 to April 3, 1849.
en-000004453	The conservative classes of society were becoming increasingly fearful of the power of the working classes in Paris.
en-000004454	They felt a strong need for organization and organized themselves around the need for "order"—the so-called "Party of Order."
en-000004455	For the Party of Order the term "order" meant a roll back of society to days of Louis Philippe.
en-000004456	The Party of Order was now the dominant member of the government.
en-000004457	On 23 June 1848, the working class of Paris rose in protest over the closure of the National Workshops.
en-000004458	On that day 170,000 citizens of Paris came out into the streets to erect barricades.
en-000004459	Cavaignac had returned from Algeria and in the elections of 23 April 1848, he was elected to the National Constituent Assembly.
en-000004460	Cavaignac arrived in Paris only on 17 May 1848 to take his seat in the National Assembly.
en-000004461	Cavaignac began a systematic assault against the revolutionary Parisian citizenry, targeting the blockaded areas of the city.
en-000004462	In February 1848, the workers and "petite bourgeoisie" had fought together, but now, in June 1848, the lines were drawn differently.
en-000004463	The working classes had been abandoned by the bourgeois politicians who founded the provisional government.
en-000004464	This would prove fatal to the Second Republic, which, without the support of the working classes, could not continue.
en-000004465	On 10 December 1848 a presidential election was held between four candidates.
en-000004466	Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin was also a candidate in that presidential election.
en-000004467	Karl Marx saw the "June Days" uprising as strong evidence of class conflict.
en-000004468	Marx saw the 1848 Revolution as being directed by the desires of the middle-class.
en-000004469	While the bourgeoisie agitated for "proper participation", workers had other concerns.
en-000004470	Many of the participants in the revolution were of the so-called "petite bourgeoisie" (small business owners).
en-000004471	However, the petty bourgeoisie was greatly indebted due to the economic recession of 1846–1847.
en-000004472	By 1848, overdue business debt was 21,000,000 francs in Paris and 11,000,000 francs in the provinces.
en-000004473	But after the revolution, the working classes were disillusioned by their small share of that participation, and revolted in the streets.
en-000004474	This frightened the bourgeoisie and they repressed the uprising during the June Days.
en-000004475	Its financial condition had deteriorated even further due to slow sales and economic dislocations of the Revolution.
en-000004476	As of June 1848, over 7,000 shopkeepers and merchants in Paris had not paid their rent since February.
en-000004477	During the June Days, their creditors and landlords (the finance bourgeoisie), forestalled most attempts to collect on those debts.
en-000004478	But once the worker revolt was put down, they began to assert their claims in court.
en-000004479	Thus, the financial bourgeoisie turned their back on the petty bourgeoisie.
en-000004480	Such a plan was introduced in the National Assembly but was rejected.
en-000004481	The petty bourgeoisie was pauperized and many small merchants became part of the working class.
en-000004482	Therefore, it tended to address only the concerns of the liberal bourgeoisie.
en-000004483	The concerns of the bourgeoisie were very different from those of the lower classes.
en-000004484	Support for the provisional government was also undermined by the memory of the French Revolution.
en-000004485	Thus, the various classes and political groupings had different reasons for supporting Napoleon in the election of December 10, 1848.
en-000004486	Napoleon himself encouraged this by "being all things to all people".
en-000004487	Legitimists (Bourbons) and Orleans (Citizen King Louis-Philippe) monarchists saw Louis Napoleon as the beginning of a royalist restoration in France.
en-000004488	The army believed Napoleon would have a foreign policy of war.
en-000004489	But, unlike in Pakistan, the army in India does not make foreign policy.
en-000004490	The industrial bourgeoisie felt that Napoleon would suppress further revolutionary activity.
en-000004491	Their support was so strong that the election has been seen as a "coup d'état" by the peasantry.
en-000004492	Following the repression of the June Days, the French Revolution of 1848 was basically over.
en-000004493	Politics in France continued to tilt to the right, as the era of revolution in France came to an end.
en-000004494	However the Party of Order and the Cavaignac dictatorship were still fearful of another popular uprising in the streets.
en-000004495	Accordingly, on 2 September 1848, the government continued the state of siege that had been in place since the June Days.
en-000004496	The new constitution was finished on 23 October 1848 and presidential elections were scheduled for 10 December 1848.
en-000004497	Louis Napoleon's family name of "Napoleon" rallied support to his cause.
en-000004498	One of those elected to the National Assembly was Adolphe Thiers who was the leader of the Orleanist party.
en-000004499	After sweeping the elections, Louis Napoleon tried to return France to the old order.
en-000004500	Cells of resistance surfaced, but were put down, and the Second Republic was officially over.

en-000004504	Several songs from these bands ended up as early Field Music recordings.
en-000004505	Their second album, "Tones Of Town", was released on 22 January 2007.
en-000004506	"We basically want to do things that aren't classed as'Field Music indie band'.
en-000004507	Field Music later confirmed that the band had not split, addressing the hiatus on their official website.
en-000004508	It was preceded by the song "(I Keep Thinking About) A New Thing", available as a free download from their website.
en-000004509	In September 2013, it was revealed that Field Music had composed a soundtrack for the 1929 silent documentary Drifters.
en-000004510	Field Music premiered the work with a live performance and screening for Berwick Film and Media Arts Festival.
en-000004511	This commission saw the original line-up of Peter Brewis, David Brewis and Andrew Moore reunite for the first time since 2007.
en-000004512	A subsequent screening and performance took place at London’s Islington Assembly Hall in November 2013.
en-000004513	David Brewis played with former Fiery Furnaces singer Eleanor Friedberger on her UK tour in the summer of 2013.
en-000004514	He released a second School Of Language album- Old Fears- in April 2014.

en-000004519	In February 2016 the band released their sixth album as Field Music, "Commontime".
en-000004520	The performance was cited in a BBC poll as one of the highlights of the series.
en-000004521	Early in 2016, the band completed their first UK tour in four years.
en-000004522	It was followed up by a US tour, which included dates in Washington, Philadelphia, New York, Boston and Seattle.
en-000004523	They also played in California for the first time since the tour to promote 2007's Tones Of Town.
en-000004524	It is the former home of the Mercantile National Bank, which later became MCorp Bank.
en-000004525	The design of the skyscraper features Moderne styling from the Art Deco era and was designed by Walter W. Ahlschlager.
en-000004526	The building has a series of setbacks that is crowned by an ornamental four-sided clock along with a decorative weather spire.
en-000004527	The Merc was the main element of a four-building complex that eventually spanned a full city block.
en-000004528	The Mercantile National Bank Building was completed in 1942 and was the only major skyscraper constructed during World War II.
en-000004529	The U.S. government had called for a halt of private construction to fuel supply materials for the war effort.
en-000004530	However, most of the tower's steel had been prefabricated and was given a special waiver from the government.
en-000004531	The bank lobby Art Deco wood murals were the largest in the world at the time.
en-000004532	The World Bank’s designation as a “bank” understates its importance and its multifaceted roles.
en-000004533	In addition to the bank and other offices, the federal government took 10 floors to hold offices for various war agencies.
en-000004534	Mercantile Bank owner and founder Robert L. Thornton constructed his own penthouse level in the upper floors.
en-000004535	In 1947, an illuminated tower was constructed, which KERA used for radio broadcasts.
en-000004536	In 1958, this tower was replaced by the current illumination tower and clock.
en-000004537	In the 1960s, the original stone façade at the base of the building was covered by a modernist curtain wall facade.
en-000004538	The Merc was the main element of a four building complex that eventually spanned a full city block.
en-000004539	It was built behind the southern half of the Securities building and ran along Commerce Street to St Paul Street.
en-000004540	The final addition to the block was the Securities Annex in 1972.
en-000004541	It initially was five stories and designed for vertical expansion at a later date.
en-000004542	The bank also built and purchased other structures near the main tower.
en-000004543	The Mercantile Continental Building was built in 1948 across Commerce Street to serve the growing bank's parking and office space needs.
en-000004544	The bank later built the Jackson Street Garage, which contained the bank's large motor bank, behind the Continental Building.
en-000004545	An underground tunnel was built to connect the garage and Continental Building to the main complex via the Dallas Building.
en-000004546	In 1976, the bank bought the neighboring Vaughn Tower across Commerce Street.
en-000004547	The final building to be built by MCorp Bank was Momentum Place, completed in 1987 across Main Street.
en-000004548	The economic downturn of the late 1980s along with the savings and loan crisis would signal the end of MCorp Bank.
en-000004549	It was dissolved by Bank One in the summer of 1989 after numerous quarters of earnings losses.
en-000004550	The complex was still used occasionally until the building became vacant on February 5, 1993.
en-000004551	The plan included demolition of the various additions and preservation of the main tower, but the project was later abandoned.
en-000004552	With the increased demand in urban living downtown, there was interest in converting the structure to residential uses.
en-000004553	However, the complex was awash with asbestos, which would need to be removed before any remodeling could begin.
en-000004554	Three different proposals fell through before Cleveland-based Forest City Enterprises was able to make the financial numbers work.
en-000004555	The main tower was converted to 225 apartments with ground floor retail.
en-000004556	On the site of the Securities Annex is a new 15-story apartment building, the Element, with parking constructed beneath.
en-000004557	Retail tenants have been slow to materialize due to economic conditions at the time of opening.
en-000004558	Forest City Enterprises will receive US$5 million from the city to convert the neighboring Continental Building into 150 additional residential units.
en-000004559	New tower clock movements and hands were manufactured in 2007 by Electric Time Company.
en-000004560	The clock hands are lighted with LEDs, which replaced the original neon.
en-000004561	Above the clock a series of LED (originally neon) lights display weather information.
en-000004562	White light rings flash upward when temperatures will rise and downward when they fall.
en-000004563	A star-shaped light at the spire's top glows green when weather forecast is fair and red when it's inclement.
en-000004564	Dallas investor and developer Timothy Headington stepped up with the estimated $270,000 needed to preserve and store the artwork.
en-000004565	A local company, Studio van Enter, cut the mosaics free of the travertine and removed the artwork in 2006.
en-000004566	Smaller decorative elements have been redisplayed in public areas of the renovated building while the larger pieces remain in storage.
en-000004567	A similar mosaic exists on the exterior of the neighboring Mercantile Continental Building.
en-000004568	The Mercantile National Bank Building is within the Dallas Independent School District.
en-000004569	Residents are zoned to City Park Elementary School, Dade Middle School, and Madison High School.
en-000004570	Kurti took his first piano lessons by Italian musician Giovanni Canale.
en-000004571	He joined the Shkodra band in 1878 and two years later became its bandmaster.
en-000004572	After the Bashkimi Shqipnis March he also composed several marches, polkas and mazurkas in the Mittel European tradition.
en-000004573	Kurti composed the songs and also wrote the texts of the songs.
en-000004574	Several songs that have been composed by Kurti have survived but many survive without attribution.
en-000004575	After his return to Shkodër in the 1890s his main occupation was composing.
en-000004576	He was exiled two more times the last time to Corfu in 1919.
en-000004577	Exhausted, he died in 1920 and his burial was followed by a multitude of people form his native town.

en-000004589	Bradley Joseph was born in Bird Island, Minnesota and raised in Willmar, Minnesota, graduating from Willmar Senior High School in 1983.
en-000004590	He learned how to play piano from a how-to piano book he found in the piano bench.
en-000004591	He started playing classical piano at age eight, taking lessons for a year and a half but was self-taught thereafter.
en-000004592	While in junior high, he took a concert field trip where he saw Buddy Rich perform.
en-000004593	I felt the power of music and knew that it was something special, a gift to be shared."
en-000004594	Joseph played piano for the jazz band and choir in high school, and trombone through high school and college.
en-000004595	He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards.
en-000004596	Later, he started performing with guitarist Dugan McNeill, whose U2-like group was signed to Polygram.
en-000004597	McNeill and Yanni had once played together in the technopop band Chameleon in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
en-000004598	When Yanni heard Joseph's compositions and arrangements, he was hired over the phone to join his core band, without ever meeting.
en-000004599	His first show was at the Starplex in Dallas with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra filming a video project.
en-000004600	"It was a real trial by fire for me", said Joseph.
en-000004601	Joseph appears on the 1994 multi-platinum album and video, "Live at the Acropolis."
en-000004602	Imagine all these different cultures coming together with the challenges of language, equipment, travel, and weather problems.
en-000004603	People still come up to me and comment how that show has affected their lives."
en-000004604	Joseph said that"Yanni gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as well.
en-000004605	He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.
en-000004606	Joseph also performed with Sheena Easton for four years as her co-musical director and lead keyboardist.
en-000004607	He went from Yanni to Easton and back to Yanni in a few years.
en-000004608	"I went back to where I started but it felt like a new invention."
en-000004609	Yanni was still building his career and maintained a hectic concert schedule.
en-000004610	Working with Easton, on the other hand, was "the best of both worlds".
en-000004611	"She just adopted a baby and is pretty settled in", said Joseph.
en-000004612	They include Charlie Adams (drums, percussion); Ric Fierabracci (fretless bass); Jeanette Clinger (vocals); and Grammy-winning violinist Charlie Bisharat.
en-000004613	Joseph's style attracted the attention of Narada Productions, a Virgin Records subsidiary, via the World Wide Web.
en-000004614	A representative for Narada came across his website and downloaded some music.
en-000004615	The outcome was "Rapture", containing intimate piano pieces, quartets, and full orchestral works.
en-000004616	It appeared that the abundance of new artists was becoming a dying breed.
en-000004617	His works are included in other Narada compilation projects as well.
en-000004618	He started Robbins Island Music in 1998, composing, producing, and distributing his own recordings.
en-000004619	"Solo Journey" was released and consists of eleven soft piano compositions that are based on mood and not on melody.
en-000004620	It is characterized by Debbage as being a "scaled down introspective,... and while simplistic was still breath-taking".
en-000004621	"The vocal expressions by Clystie Whang and Joseph have devotional qualities that weave through the atmospheres and soundscapes smoothly."
en-000004622	"The Journey Continues ", a sequel to"Solo Journey", features Joseph on solo piano.
en-000004623	Debbage writes,"The magical world of movies has a knack for exploring sequels.
en-000004624	There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway.
en-000004625	The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters.
en-000004626	Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with "Solo Journey" that was released back in 2000.
en-000004627	I am glad to report that "The Journey Continues" is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor."
en-000004628	Subsequent releases include "For the Love of It", "Piano Love Songs", and "Hymns and Spiritual Songs".

en-000004635	"Paint the Sky" (2013) was nominated for Best Neo-Classical Album in the 10th annual ZMR Music Awards.
en-000004636	He spends most of his time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works.
en-000004637	I can change directions", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta.
en-000004638	As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said.
en-000004639	You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent."
en-000004640	"I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said.
en-000004641	He said,"Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business.
en-000004642	Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses."
en-000004643	Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants.
en-000004644	He advises,"...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time.
en-000004645	And that kind of success is as good as I could have ever wished for."
en-000004646	When he decided to become a solo artist he wanted to be comfortable in his environment and moved back.
en-000004647	First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement.
en-000004648	Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view.
en-000004649	Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right.
en-000004650	"In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.
en-000004651	It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it.
en-000004652	And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences."
en-000004653	He believes that "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words."
en-000004654	Yanni once said, "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift".
en-000004655	Joseph employs a variety of instruments to compose including the Korg Triton music workstation, Korg SG-1 piano, and occasionally Korg M1.
en-000004656	Rack units have included Roland JD-800, and Roland JV-1080 which he says is "great for string layers".
en-000004657	Acoustic pianos vary, Yamaha and Bösendorfer were used for the 1997 album, "Rapture".
en-000004658	Joseph's musical style and direction have varied over time, having released more than two hundred original compositions and arrangements since 1994.
en-000004659	"When I write it, it just kind of moves, because where I am in life is different", Joseph said.
en-000004660	For instance, the song "Dance of Life" was inspired by Antonín Dvořák's opera, "Rusalka".
en-000004661	Debbage depicts "A Minnesota Snowfall" from "Christmas Around the World" as taking "a more naked, bare-boned ballad approach".
en-000004662	Joseph has also produced numerous CDs that include cover arrangements for piano and orchestra.
en-000004663	The 2009 release of "Suites& Sweets" features compositions by Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and other classical composers.
en-000004664	Kathy Parsons of "MainlyPiano" states"The thirteen pieces...range from tender to majestic.
en-000004665	Several pieces are solo piano and others are orchestrated with keyboards to give a vibrant, cinematic effect."
en-000004666	Building as it evolves, it never takes a breath until near the end of the theme.
en-000004667	Parsons details this as "much calmer and more graceful with a piano melody and keyboard enhancements".
en-000004668	Debbage writes that"the remainder of the album is filled with Joseph’s uncanny ability to compose elegant and emotive ballads.
en-000004669	The songs can sound like musical cotton candy— soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting.
en-000004670	The Town of Fort Erie has provided public bus service since 1977.

en-000004704	After a year working for Richardson, Jones, with his bride Bertha Juliet Tucker, moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in September 1883.
en-000004705	Jones is credited with introducing Shingle Style architecture to Minneapolis soon after he arrived in the area.
en-000004706	He is widely admired for his use of shingle coverage in a clubhouse design for the Minnetonka Yacht Club (1890–1943).
en-000004707	Respected by colleagues for his design versatility, Jones was also masterful at understanding structural engineering.
en-000004708	Described as possessing both an artist’s eye and engineer’s intellect, he set both aptitudes to work in winning combination.
en-000004709	Following the introduction of the new classes, he became the school’s first formally trained professor.
en-000004710	He was well known for his many proposals on behalf of the city’s cyclist, even petitioning for a race in 1887.
en-000004711	In addition to his civic duties on the Park Board, Jones designed thirteen recreation buildings between 1889 and 1930.
en-000004712	In 1932, he began one of his last Minneapolis designs—the water tower built in his Washburn Park neighborhood.
en-000004713	Still standing today as a city landmark, the tower was placed on the National Historic Register in 1983.
en-000004714	Harry Wild Jones was married to Bertha Juliet Tucker on September 3, 1883.

en-000004717	Argentine–United Kingdom relations refers to foreign relations between Argentina and the United Kingdom.
en-000004718	Diplomatic relations were cut off before the Falklands War in 1982 and were reinstated in 1990.
en-000004719	Post-war relations between the two countries improved significantly up until the mid-2000s.
en-000004720	Argentina has an embassy in London and the United Kingdom has an embassy in Buenos Aires.
en-000004721	The modern territory of Argentina was initially part of the Spanish Empire.
en-000004722	The first British attack invaded Buenos Aires, the city was liberated by Santiago de Liniers with forces from Montevideo.
en-000004723	Britain stayed neutral during the conflict, and accepted the Argentine Declaration of Independence on December 15, 1823.
en-000004724	The formal relations were established with the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Between Argentina and the United Kingdom.
en-000004725	In 1896, problems with the demarcation, the decision had to undergo an arbitration award in Britain.
en-000004726	At that time, Moreno was appointed expert on behalf of the Argentine government.
en-000004727	According to the 2001 UK Census, some 3,932 Argentine-born people were living in the UK.
en-000004728	There is a strong British cultural influence in Argentina and a large Argentine-British community around Buenos Aires.
en-000004729	There is also a strong Welsh-speaking Argentine-Welsh community in Chubut, Patagonia.
en-000004730	A large number of Argentine football players play for British clubs.

en-000004738	Around 100,000 Anglo-Argentines are the descendants of English immigrants to Argentina.
en-000004739	They are one of the most successful immigrant groups of Argentina, gaining prominence in commerce, industry, and the professions.
en-000004740	Many are noted by their ability to speak English in family circles with an undistinguishable English accent.
en-000004741	An English-language newspaper, the "Buenos Aires Herald", continues to be published daily in Buenos Aires.
en-000004742	Anglo-Argentines have traditionally differed from their fellow Argentines by largely retaining strong ties with their mother country, including education and commerce.
en-000004743	Blue blazers and grey flannels are still used as uniforms in most private schools.
en-000004744	The Anglo-Argentine Society, based in London, was founded in 1948 and has about 900 members.
en-000004745	It is a society for Argentine people living in the United Kingdom, particularly those of Anglo-Argentine heritage.
en-000004746	One of its main aims is to promote understanding and friendship between the two countries.
en-000004747	The club is for those with a particular link to, or special interest in, Argentina and other Latin American countries.
en-000004748	The Coghlan neighbourhood in Buenos Aires, known for its large English-style residences, was originally inhabited by English and Irish immigrants.
en-000004749	In 1891 Hutton established the Association Argentine Football League, the first football league outside of the British Isles.
en-000004750	The Argentinean government granted the request as it put them in control of a large tract of land.
en-000004751	The town which grew near the spot where they landed is now named Puerto Madryn.
en-000004752	On their return to Wales they declared the area to be very suitable for colonisation.
en-000004753	Some died and a baby, Mary Humphries, was born on the march.
en-000004754	John Williams was the only colonist with any form of rudimentary medical skill.
en-000004755	They arrived at Picton island in Tierra del Fuego in December 1850, but their food began to run out.
en-000004756	They had expected scheduled supplies, however they did not arrive, and by September 1851 they had died from sickness and hunger.
en-000004757	The Patagonia Mission continued and in 1854 changed its name to the South American Missionary Society.
en-000004758	In January 1869 the Society established a mission at Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego under its superintendent, Waite Hockin Stirling.
en-000004759	In 1914 the first mission, Misión Chaqueña, was founded in the north of Argentina.
en-000004760	This resulted in the British deploying forces to the Falkland Islands to fight in the Falklands War.
en-000004761	Argentina now has an embassy in London and the United Kingdom has an embassy in Buenos Aires.
en-000004762	Relations improved further in the 1990s between the UK and Argentina.
en-000004763	Since the mid-2000s, diplomatic relations between the UK and Argentina have become increasingly strained.
en-000004764	In 2006, Argentina renewed claims to the Falkland Islands, citing concern over fishing and petroleum rights.
en-000004765	Since 2010, reports of British oil exploration around the Falkland Islands have caused a further downturn in UK-Argentine relations.
en-000004766	Governments of South American countries have generally shown support for Argentina over the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute in recent years.
en-000004767	This is in contrast to the Falklands War when Britain was supported by Chile.
en-000004768	The Unasur group of nations has asked the United Kingdom to pursue negotiations over the islands'sovereignty.
en-000004769	President Kirchner then attempted to hand an envelope to the Prime Minister but he refused to accept it.
en-000004770	In March 2013 the Falkland Islanders voted overwhelmingly in a referendum for the territory to remain British.

en-000004807	The poverty prevailed in the country has been the breeding ground for the communist oriented chauvinistic politics in the country.
en-000004808	It has to keep itself a bit left to the centre on order to check ultra left chauvinism.
en-000004809	Economic development is the only way left to make people realize the fruits of democracy and freedom.
en-000004810	Such market- friendly interventions of the government would only bolster the private sector.
en-000004811	Decentralization is the only way through which the government would be able to exert its usefulness in an egalitarian manner.
en-000004812	It is only through decentralization that political, economic and social power can be delegated to a common man.
en-000004813	Globally, we must allow political and social power to establish their rightful place next to economic power.
en-000004814	The common man should be able to participate in the development process actively through local self-government.
en-000004815	It is through the approach of decentralization that people’s power can be geared up gradually.
en-000004816	The experiences earned by developed democratic countries in this context would prove vivid inspirations for us.
en-000004817	The 1974 United States elections were held on November 5, and elected the members of the 94th United States Congress.
en-000004818	In addition, an energy crisis hit the country at this time, resulting in soaring inflation.
en-000004819	In 2010, inflation in some of the crisis countries lagged slightly behind that of their eurozone competitors.
en-000004820	These circumstances, along with the six-year itch phenomenon, hurt the Republicans, and they lost seats in both houses of Congress.
en-000004821	The Democrats made a net gain of four Senate seats from the Republicans.
en-000004822	Democrat John A. Durkin won a special election in New Hampshire after the Senate voided the original contested election.

en-000004829	General music classes are taken up to Grade 4, whereas, in Grade 5, they are replaced with band, choir and strings.
en-000004830	Both are then compulsory until high school, where students can then choose to continue taking one or both.
en-000004831	All middle school students are required to take art and drama classes in alternating semesters.
en-000004832	In high school, students can choose to take art or drama.
en-000004833	Upon entering high school, students can either continue taking courses in Mandarin or take classes in French.

en-000004841	After a few years, a new campus was opened in Lai Yu.
en-000004842	The Shek Mun campus, was constructed to represent God's hands spread out.
en-000004843	The first three floors of the building are shared by both the elementary and the secondary.
en-000004844	These floors contain most of the music rooms, the two gymnasiums, and various rooms used by the administration.
en-000004845	The next four floors consist of general classrooms, computer labs, labs, the libraries, and the art rooms.
en-000004846	Finally, the seventh floor is used to house new teachers and their families for their first year at the school.
en-000004847	The building's floor numbers start at the ground floor, following the British system commonly used in Hong Kong.
en-000004848	Tasmania has a complex geological history, with the world's biggest exposure of diabase, or dolerite.
en-000004849	The rock record contains representatives of each period of the Neoproterozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cainozoic eras.
en-000004850	It is one of the few southern hemisphere areas glaciated during the Pleistocene with glacial landforms in the higher parts.
en-000004851	The west coast region hosts significant mineralisation and numerous active and historic mines.
en-000004852	Older rocks from western Tasmania and King Island were strongly folded and metamorphosed into rocks such as quartzite.
en-000004853	Then there were volcanic action and sediments from the Cambrian and Ordovician.
en-000004854	Rocks in tasmania are mainly found on the beach, relatively close to the shore.
en-000004855	When these rocks erode, they form the sand we all love.
en-000004856	The process is what formed the famous Bondi Beach in Australia.
en-000004857	In the Permian period, conditions were again glacial and the Tasmania basin formed, with low sea levels in the Triassic.
en-000004858	In the Cainozoic, a couple of basins extended inland from Macquarie Harbour and the northern Midlands.
en-000004859	The oldest rocks in Tasmania from the Precambrian form several blocks.
en-000004860	The islands oldest rocks seem to have originated when that part of the island was attached to western North America.
en-000004861	These minerals, strongly resemble those found in Montana, Idaho and southern British Columbia.
en-000004862	Importantly, at more than 1 billion years old, the fossils are some of the oldest visible to the naked eye.
en-000004863	The rocks of Tasmania are much older than those of the east coast of Australia indicating a different geologic history.
en-000004864	On King Island now in Bass Strait, the oldest Tasmanian rocks are found.
en-000004865	Sedimentary rocks such as feldspathic sandstone that have been altered to schist and quartzite.
en-000004866	The Wickham deformation affected the earlier rocks by heating to 470 to 480 °C at pressures below 300 MPa, and tight folding.
en-000004867	Also dykes of augite syenite, picrite and tholeiite dolerite were intruded.
en-000004868	An interpretation is that deposits occurred in a tidal area, with a continental rift allowing magma from the mantle to intrude.
en-000004869	The sequence covers most of the element and is over 5700 metres thick.
en-000004870	The metamorphic belt titled the Arthur Lineament forms the limits of the Rocky Cape Group to the south east.
en-000004871	The Oonah Formation has even more varieties of rock than the Burnie formation, also including conglomerate, quartz sandstone, dolomite and chert.
en-000004872	The Togari group contains greywacke, conglomerate, diamictite, mafic volcanic rocks, and quartz sandstone, and mudstone.
en-000004873	Near Corinna the Ahrberg group is correlated with the Togari Group and the Success Creek Group.
en-000004874	The Dundas Element lowest level starts with the Oonah Formation with greywacke, dolomite and basic volcanics.
en-000004875	It has three sections, Mount Bischoff Inlier, the Ramsay River Inlier and the Dundas Inlier.
en-000004876	The Success Creek Group from the Cryogenian has diamictite, quartz sandstone (Dalcoath Formation), and mudstone.
en-000004877	It includes the Renison Bell Formation named after the Renison Bell mine.
en-000004878	The sediments slumped while soft forming folds and breccia and mélange.
en-000004879	The basalt is probably the same as mafic lavas of the Kanunnah Subgroup.
en-000004880	It contains structural elements called Dial Range Trough, Forth Massif, Fossey Mountains Trough.
en-000004881	The oldest Precambrian rocks are the Ulverstone Metamorphic Complex and Forth Metamorphic Complex.
en-000004882	It is found in the Dial Range and Fossey Mountain Troughs, up to 1 km thick.
en-000004883	It consists of pillow lava, massive lava flows, sediments made from volcanic fragments, and chert breccia.
en-000004884	To the west of the Badger Head Inlier is the Port Sorell Formation, a tectonic mélange of marine sediments and dolerite.
en-000004885	In the Tyennan block, the Precambrian basement that forms the central core of Tasmania there are two formations.
en-000004886	First, the Oonah Formation contains turbidite with quartz sandstone interbedded with siltstone deposited by gravity flows.
en-000004887	This has been deformed with tight folds that have been overturned, and exhibits crenulation cleavage and brittle faulting.
en-000004888	At Raglan Range the rocks are a mixture of quartzite and knotted schist.
en-000004889	Metamorphism in this area was higher grade with almandine garnet forming.
en-000004890	Eclogite and garnet amphibolite are believed to be the remains of basalt.
en-000004891	The eclogite has been heated to 700° at 1520 MPa, a burial depth of perhaps 50 km.
en-000004892	In the Neoproterozoic in the Jane River basin, the very thick Jane River Dolomite appeared.
en-000004893	It also underlies the Tasmania Basin across southeastern Tasmania, but not including the east coast.
en-000004894	The subsurface structure has been studied from a few outliers, boreholes, xenoliths, and gravity and magnetic surveys.
en-000004895	The basement at 5 km deep is the same as the Tyennan metamorphic rocks (Scotchfire Metamorphic Complex).
en-000004896	Its oldest exposed rocks are from the Clark Group, of pelitic rocks, some with stromatolites, and evaporites, and overlaid with orthoquartzite.
en-000004897	Glacial dropstones are found in the interbedding, suggesting Cryogenian age, however carbon isotope results suggest Ediacaran age instead.
en-000004898	It is separated from Neoproterozoic rocks by a low angle thrust fault.
en-000004899	South east of this is a metamorphosed belt of dolomite rich sediments correlated with the Oonah Formation.
en-000004900	An ultramafic belt called Point Hibbs Mélange reaches the coast near Point Hibbs.
en-000004901	This has been complexly faulted with Cambrian, Ordovician and Devonian sediments and limestone.
en-000004902	The far north west also had uplift as probably also did some region to the east.
en-000004903	Basins formed were the Smithton Basin, Dial Range Basin, Fossey Mountain Basin and the Adamsfield Basin.
en-000004904	This resulted in deep oceanic crust being thrust in a sheet over the top of the Precambrian rocks.
en-000004905	This has left behind several ultramafic complexes bounded with faults from the older rocks.
en-000004906	These take the form of layered pyroxenite and dunite; layered dunite, and harzburgite; and layered pyroxenite, peridotite and gabbro.
en-000004907	The ultrabasic rocks are rich in orthopyroxene, which is unusual, usually clinopyroxene is found.
en-000004908	Other ultramaphic occurrences are called Cape Sorell and Serpentine Hill Complex.
en-000004909	As part of this collision, three exotic suites of basalt were tectonically introduced into the Dundas Block.
en-000004910	This magma produced the layered pyroxenite dunite in the ultramafic area.
en-000004911	They are not ophiolites, but instead are cumulates of heavy minerals in a shallow magma chamber.
en-000004912	The densest mineral, osmiridium has been concentrated and mined at Adamsfield.
en-000004913	These rocks are allochthonous, meaning that they were inserted into position by tectonic processes.
en-000004914	The massive sulfides were formed by hot springs on the sea floor.
en-000004915	These have become ore deposits for copper, lead, zinc and silver.
en-000004916	The Sticht Range Beds form a sedimentary base sitting on the Tyennan Block metamorphic rocks.
en-000004917	This was followed by the Radfords Creek Group which has a base of a conglomerate of chert and basalt fragments.
en-000004918	In the Adamsfield area the Trial Ridge Beds, Island Road Formation, and Boyd River Formation consists of conglomerate and greywacke.
en-000004919	Major mineral deposits were formed at Mount Lyell, Rosebery and Henty.
en-000004920	Granite also intruded in the Cambrian at Low Rocky Point and Elliott Bay.
en-000004921	The Dundas group are Cambrian sedimentary beds that interfinger with the Mount Read Volcanics.
en-000004922	The conglomerate includes volcanic fragments where it borders the Mount Read Volcanics, indicating that it was deposited at the same time.
en-000004923	In the Smithton Synclinorium the Scopus Formation is from the same period between Boomerangian and Idamean.
en-000004924	The rocks are wacke and mudstone in a submarine fan with currents flowing to the north.
en-000004925	Most of the material came from volcanics, but also included grit from the older Precambrian rocks.
en-000004926	The Fossey Mountains Trough contains Cambrian intermediate volcanics, and greywacke where trilobite fossils show the age as late Middle Cambrian.
en-000004927	During the Ordovician Tasmania was near the equator and was joined to Gondwana.
en-000004928	The Tyennan Block was uplifted with the Great Lyell Scarp as an active fault.
en-000004929	The Owen Conglomerate, part of the Denison group lies conformably on the Dundas Group, but unconformably on the Mount Read Volcanics.
en-000004930	The pebbles include quartz, quartzite, quartz sandstone, pale pink mudstone and chert, embedded in a matrix of sand.

en-000005448	Public-Private Partnerships in transition economies have become increasingly popular since 1990.
en-000005449	PPP has yet to prove that it is appropriate in transition economies because of political and economic differences.
en-000005450	Two broad categories of the PPPs can be identified: joint ventures between public and private stakeholders; and contractual PPPs.
en-000005451	Five countries—Brazil, PRC, India, Poland, and Russian Federation—accounted for more than 40% of activity in 1990–2003.
en-000005452	The success or failure of PPP projects has not been systematically assessed (Roseneau, 1999).
en-000005453	In Africa, PPPs have been successfully implemented in transport, telecommunications, water and sanitation, power, and eco-tourism.
en-000005454	In Bangladesh, the Infrastructure Investment Facilitation Center (IIFC) facilitates private sector investment.
en-000005455	As a result of IIFC efforts, the telecom sector has become a very active private investment area.
en-000005456	In India, the Government of India (GOI) developed enabling tools and activities to spur private sector investments using PPPs.
en-000005457	In Vietnam, trial regulations for PPP infrastructure development took effect on January 15, 2011.
en-000005458	Advocates contend that PPP successes in developed countries lay a good foundation for PPPs in developing countries.
en-000005459	They claim that giving more space to the competitive private sector produces greater efficiencies and increases innovation and improved quality.
en-000005460	Given the right incentives and environment, the private sector can also mobilize the capital necessary for expensive infrastructures and services.
en-000005461	Infrastructure is another obvious place to expand private-sector involvement.
en-000005462	According to the United Nations, good governance is open to much interpretation but six core principles are widely accepted:
en-000005463	Health in Guatemala is focused on many different systems of prevention and care.
en-000005464	Guatemala’s Constitution states that every citizen has the universal right to health care.
en-000005465	The health care system in place today developed out of the Civil War in Guatemala.
en-000005466	The Civil War prevented social reforms from occurring, especially in the sector of health care.
en-000005467	Today, there have been many reforms to the health care system, but the current system continues to have significant problems.
en-000005468	The system requires a lot of change in order to serve the whole Guatemalan community.
en-000005469	When the Civil War broke out in Guatemala, social improvements in health care were brought to a halt.
en-000005470	The period of the 34-year Civil War (from 1954-mid 1980s) resulted in many changes within the health sector.
en-000005471	Immediately after the war, Guatemala saw little change in the healthcare sector.
en-000005472	Today, the Guatemalan health care system is split into three separate divisions: the public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit sectors.
en-000005473	This sector of the health care system formally covers about 88% of the population.
en-000005474	The private sector, which accounts for about 12% of the population, includes many for-profit providers, non-profit entities, and traditional local providers.
en-000005475	As a share of GDP, health care spending in Guatemala is one of the lowest in Central America (2.6 percent).
en-000005476	In total, the Guatemalan government's expenditures on health were about $196 US dollars in 2010.
en-000005477	The Peace Accords, which were signed in 1996, called for a change in health provision goals.
en-000005478	There are many communicable diseases and conditions that threaten the livelihood of the Guatemalan people on a day-to-day basis.
en-000005479	Furthermore, in Guatemala, parasites, diabetes, and malnutrition are huge health problems.
en-000005480	Given the prevalence of poverty, many residents have limited access to quality nutrition, limited education, and higher rates of disease.
en-000005481	Also, in Guatemala, the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and obesity has risen.
en-000005482	In Guatemala, communicable diseases for which treatment exists are still one of the major causes of death.
en-000005483	The high mortality rate for infants is a direct result of communicable and infectious diseases.
en-000005484	In Guatemala, 56 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.
en-000005485	In a country like Guatemala, water is poor and frequently contaminated.
en-000005486	In order to decrease common communicable diseases like diarrhea, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and respiratory disease, clean water and sanitation are necessary.
en-000005487	With the health care system's provision of both clean water and food, the incidence of infectious and communicable diseases will decrease.
en-000005488	Parasites present one of the biggest threats to health in Guatemala.
en-000005489	Many of the common parasites in developing countries like Guatemala are spread through contamination of both water and food.
en-000005490	This is an all-too-common tale for developing countries that experience an oil bonanza.
en-000005491	It has been seen that the prevalence of parasites is significantly higher among younger children and those who are malnourished.
en-000005492	School children who have been treated for parasites immediately perform significantly better in school settings.
en-000005493	Parasite infections can also vary based on access to clean water and whether or not sewage disposal is present.
en-000005494	Parasites can have serious long-term consequences in that they directly affect development and health for decades after.
en-000005495	However, inexpensive, single-dose medications exist that can fully treat these parasitic infections.
en-000005496	As a rising public health concern, diabetes largely threatens the indigenous population of Guatemala.
en-000005497	Indigenous areas are particularly under-resourced with respect to doctors and overall health care programs.
en-000005498	A risk factor for diabetes within the indigenous population is dietary change over time.
en-000005499	A large issue for the indigenous population and the greater Guatemalan population in general is access to medication.
en-000005500	One aspect of the Guatemalan health care system is its focus on Mayan health.
en-000005501	Because the Mayan population is so prevalent in Guatemala, it is necessary to consider their barriers to quality health care.
en-000005502	The life expectancy for Mayans can be up to 10 or 15 years lower than other Guatemalans.
en-000005503	Such inequalities can largely be attributed to a large language barrier between the indigenous population and the non-indigenous peoples.
en-000005504	Generally, the indigenous people of Guatemala speak only a variety of local Mayan languages.
en-000005505	In relation to health care, these language barriers can be significant.
en-000005506	Most of the medical professionals that serve the indigenous communities are Ladino, and speak Spanish only.
en-000005507	The indigenous population is unable to communicate with the doctors directly, which is both difficult and embarrassing.
en-000005508	discovered that the combination of poverty and language barriers made indigenous women less likely to seek services from health care providers.
en-000005509	The Mayan diet is different from the diet of non-indigenous Guatemalans.
en-000005510	Throughout their history, the Maya have used maize as a principal crop.
en-000005511	Corn has a significant amount of carbohydrates, which in turn increases blood sugar levels.
en-000005512	This increase in blood sugar makes diabetes a very common disease within the Mayan population.
en-000005513	Also, with this lack of crucial nutrients, malnutrition is very prominent in the indigenous population.
en-000005514	The Mayan people frequently live in rural villages of Guatemala, which are generally known to be impoverished areas.
en-000005515	About 80% of indigenous Guatemalans live below the"international poverty line.
en-000005516	For centuries, the relationship between the Ladinos and the Mayans has been antagonistic.
en-000005517	Similarly, the Ladino doctors that work in the health field make the indigenous people feel powerless and guarded instead of supported.
en-000005518	The inaccessibility of the clinics leads to fewer visits and more health complications in the indigenous population.
en-000005519	Severe health and nutritional deficiencies are associated with deaths of children under the age of 5.
en-000005520	Most of the time, services that are provided for contraceptive health do not reach the at-risk population.
en-000005521	As of 2015, it is estimated that Guatemala's infant mortality rate is 22.73 for every 1,000 live births.
en-000005522	Infants are more susceptible to infectious diseases and conditions like malaria, which can cause severe morbidity, and even death.
en-000005523	For infants, physical growth is critical to proper and successful development.
en-000005524	Malnutrition is a serious condition that threatens the health and well-being of many people in developing nations.
en-000005525	In Guatemala, nutritional deficiencies have been shown to severely impact the growth and development of children both physically and mentally.
en-000005526	According to Gragnolati and Marini, over 44 percent of the Guatemalan child population is chronically malnourished.
en-000005527	Reproductive health focuses on the health of infants as well as mothers.
en-000005528	Guatemala is only beginning their transition into a more health-centered nation.
en-000005529	When the reproductive age is young, there can be many catastrophic effects.
en-000005530	Maternal health problems affect women throughout Guatemala, but are significantly more prevalent in poorer, more rural areas.
en-000005531	Indigenous women frequently have unsafe living conditions, which makes them more susceptible to health related problems.
en-000005532	In Guatemala, knowledge and education about contraceptives and family planning is incredibly low, especially within the indigenous population.
en-000005533	More education about the implications of reproduction can reduce population growth while simultaneously improving both maternal and infant health.
en-000005534	There is very little knowledge about health care services related to pregnancy and abortions.
en-000005535	Abortions are illegal in Guatemala, and are only permitted if it will save the mothers life.
en-000005536	Typically, in Guatemala, the general population is poor and has little access to quality health care services.
en-000005537	The indigenous population and the Ladinos generally use traditional and formal health practices respectively.
en-000005538	Differences in economic and social influences determine contraceptive use, child immunizations, prenatal care, and childbirth or delivery.
en-000005539	For the two populations within Guatemala, there are many large disparities between family planning actions.
en-000005540	Family planning services are as scarce as health care services in the rural areas of Guatemala.
en-000005541	A family life education class provides information pertaining to sex education, as well as reproductive health.
en-000005542	Education is an aspect of health that is generally ignored by the Guatemalan health care system.
en-000005543	Proper education on nutrition and contraceptives has proven to impact both education levels and survival.
en-000005544	In children, proper nutrition has been shown to accelerate development, both mentally and physically.
en-000005545	Health education provides mothers with resources to handle health issues and gives them access to knowledgeable sources outside their specific communities.
en-000005546	Many Guatemalans do not have enough knowledge about health care to make concrete health decisions and know the results of outcomes.
en-000005547	Education is required in order to provide both indigenous and non-indigenous Guatemalans with the understanding to make personal health choices.
en-000005548	The education of school children and quality nutrition status have both shown to affect adult education levels.
en-000005549	Within the Mayan population of Guatemala, education is not as accessible.
en-000005550	However, it has also been observed that the indigenous population does not utilize health care services as readily.
en-000005551	discovered that the indigenous mothers actually did have a significant affinity for health seeking behaviors.
en-000005552	In considering hygiene and sexually transmitted diseases, preventative education can alone hinder the onset of disease.
en-000005553	In the field of education, knowledge about health outcomes is necessary, as well as poor health origins.
en-000005554	Many of the deaths that occur frequently in Guatemala are a result of preventable and treatable diseases.
en-000005555	In Guatemala, doctors only treat 24% of indigenous people, whereas they treat almost double that amount for non-indigenous Guatemalans.
en-000005556	Preventable diseases can be eliminated with the implementation of these services and with the influence of education.
en-000005557	The United States'prison population topped 2 million inmates for the first time in history on June 30, 2002.
en-000005558	By this time, America’s jails held 1 in every 142 U.S. residents.
en-000005559	The prison abolition movement attempts to eliminate prisons and the prison system.
en-000005560	Prison abolitionists see the prisons as an ineffective way to decrease crime and reform criminals.
en-000005561	They also believe the modern criminal justice system to be racist, sexist, and classist.
en-000005562	The Anarchist Black Cross was a key group involved in the prison abolition movement that still persists today.
en-000005563	A variety of proposed alternatives to prisons arose from the prison abolition movement.
en-000005564	The prison reform and alternatives to incarceration has been largely supported by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime(UNODC).
en-000005565	Imprisonment often takes away the basic liberties of human rights as declared in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
en-000005566	Many inmates in the U.S. prison system have voiced the inhumane conditions that they were subjected to during their time.
en-000005567	For those who have experience sexual abuse, the obligatory search brings up traumatic experiences and episodes.
en-000005568	Similar to this example, many inmates are subjected to unfair treatments and abuse from prison guards.
en-000005569	Mass incarceration has been found to decrease the overall economic circumstances of families.
en-000005570	This is due in part from the overcrowding of jail cells and the high concentration of diseases and substance abuse.
en-000005571	Rearrest rates in addition to newly convicted individuals, add on to the burden of taxpayers.
en-000005572	Financial circumstances are not the only factor affected when one is imprisoned.
en-000005573	However, their conditions only continue to worsen after their time at penal institutions.
en-000005574	Due to the increased, overcrowded populations of prisons and the lack of medical personnels, many of the prisoners'conditions deteriorate.
en-000005575	Many groups and organizations have stepped forward to push for an end to incarceration.
en-000005576	These groups, for example, the Anarchist Black Cross have developed a strong passion to abolish the prison system completely.
en-000005577	These benefits can be summarized in four categories: judicial, economic, social, and safety.
en-000005578	Limiting consequences of crime to only imprisonment may lead to oversimplification of diverse and complicated crimes, resulting in the situation above.
en-000005579	For a court to truly be cost-effective, fair, and efficient, other options like rehabilitation may be more favorable.
en-000005580	It is also possible for alternatives to incarceration to save money and keep government lean.
en-000005581	Federal prison and private prison solutions to crime cost over $28,000 per year per inmate.
en-000005582	Any option that costs below this price point is a viable way to save money.
en-000005583	In addition, cumulative costs resulting from prison overcrowding can be avoided, saving even more money.
en-000005584	In comparison, a drug court system costs below $10,000 per year per offender.
en-000005585	Spending the full price as an inmate on each offender is more expensive than tailoring options for each separate case.
en-000005586	A push for alternatives to incarceration in politics would lead to a more cohesive viewpoint between society and government policy.
en-000005587	Whereas prison does not have focused efforts designed to reform and redirect criminals towards better futures, oftentimes alternatives to incarceration do.
en-000005588	This leads to a safer environment for everyone when these offenders finish their respective sentences and return to society.
en-000005589	Therefore, sex offending needs to be seen within a public health framework rather than a criminal justice one.
en-000005590	Parents presenting a positive influence should go through intensive parenting and close monitoring and supervision.
en-000005591	Mothers being incarcerated are subjected to a form of alternative during their incarceration.
en-000005592	Studies have provided an alternative to the relationships between children and their mothers whom are incarcerated.
en-000005593	Around 70% of women incarcerated have children that are minors and many of them include pregnant women.
en-000005594	The program was established to create a positive development in the children’s lives and have mothers avoid recidivism.
en-000005595	Some cases have shown a decrease in maternal recidivism and a growth in gender-responsive program offered by the government toward women.
en-000005596	Even though these women have to attend parenting programs, the objective of classes is unknown to be effective to the individuals.
en-000005597	Dealing with drugs is more likely for the individual to be recidivated and go back to jail within three years.
en-000005598	Coming from a low income household is already a struggle, as a parent the amount one pays is indefinite.
en-000005599	Fathers who have low income and have to pay child support have a high possibility of being incarcerated.
en-000005600	Their relationship with their children fades away for a while as the father becomes absent in his time behind bars.
en-000005601	Incarceration prevents them from fulfilling their jobs not just to the economy, but as fathers as well.
en-000005602	Incarceration creates more debt towards the individual than aid to society.
en-000005603	The ATI module attempts to give fathers preparatory skills and confidence of securing a job for themselves.
en-000005604	Incarceration for not paying child support had alternatives that did not have a positive outcome.
en-000005605	Alternatives such as burying the fathers in debt rather than helping them find a resolution to their problem.
en-000005606	Home Detention is another way in which it alters from incarceration.
en-000005607	Instead of being inside a prison, the prison comes to the individual at the footsteps of their homes.
en-000005608	Fathers are being charged for monitoring expenses and have no employment during that period since they cannot leave their homes.
en-000005609	They are not working and not able to see their children.
en-000005610	Then they will be re-incarcerated and nothing is beneficiary to either the economy and/or individual.
en-000005611	ATI program has eligibility criteria as well as steps to appeal for one.
en-000005612	Then there was certain criteria to be eligible to be in this program.
en-000005613	It is crucial to understand how alternatives to incarceration or detention for minors are developed and implemented.
en-000005614	Restorative justice in the forms of boot camps and military programs adopted into public education options is starting to be considered.
en-000005615	have been developed and those working with academics are called upon to develop such alternatives.
en-000005616	Kentucky has passed a bill in which the state encourages community-based treatment over detention for juveniles.
en-000005617	Canada has also researched and tried to understand what Community Program works best for different types of crime offenders.
en-000005618	Some alternatives introduced in this article include confinement, community service, tracking devices, and expanded terms in halfway houses.
en-000005619	Some other ideas include an increase in supervision for a decrease in time as an alternative to long-term imprisonment.
en-000005620	This technically wouldn’t be an alternative to incarceration, but rather to full-term supervision.
en-000005621	There are often cases such as with parents and drug abusers that need special attention and aren’t so easy to incarcerate.
en-000005622	When it comes to parents, the court should determine what kind of parent the defendant is.
en-000005623	For less dangerous criminals, treatment facilities should be the first option.
en-000005624	The Residential Drug Abuse Program helps inmates addicted to drugs get released early, through the overcoming of their addiction.
en-000005625	Nancy Stein emphasizes on deinstitutionalizing young people by creating community-based alternatives.
en-000005626	As a result, the Omega Boys Club has contributed in decreasing the rate of juvenile crime.
en-000005627	Native American communities, particularly reservations in the United States and Canada, have had a reputation for high crime rates.
en-000005628	Restorative justice is an important alternative to the Prison Industrial Complex in these communities.
en-000005629	Native Americans are largely overrepresented in Western penal systems, and are moving towards self-determination in administering restorative justice to their communities.
en-000005630	Some alternatives that have been suggested are community-based programs, participation in Western sentencing circles, and re-institution of traditional corporal punishment.
en-000005631	There has long been evidence of an inverse relationship between these two systems.
en-000005632	Prisoners who took the course received a certificate of completion and were accepted into universities with financial aid included.
en-000005633	Many are currently college students, and their acceptance letters were shown to other prisoners which encouraged them to take the course.
en-000005634	Judges have the option of sending those with misdemeanors or felonies to this program instead of giving them a prison sentence.
en-000005635	The program has four categories: general population, substance abusers, women, and youth.
en-000005636	The program has a 60% success rate, which is relatively high.
en-000005637	Offenders who fail the program receive a mandatory prison sentence, which gives them good incentive to succeed.
en-000005638	An adjustment program succeeds or fails at home, not in Brussels or Washington.
en-000005639	Those who don’t succeed tend to have a past with incarceration.
en-000005640	As the biggest city in the United States, New York City is often a trendsetter for other cities.
en-000005641	This program could be the first of many in the United States, which could help lower incarceration rates.
en-000005642	Sison's vision uses Marxist–Leninist–Maoist principles for social analysis and in carrying out people's democracy or national democracy:
en-000005643	As a former U.S. colony, the Philippines'dynamic with the United States dates back to the Philippine–American War.
en-000005644	The movement seeks to advance national democracy and freedom from imperialism in the Philippines.
en-000005645	The ND movement is interwoven with a larger global alliance: the International League of Peoples'Struggle (ILPS).
en-000005646	The larger and more global the company, the larger and more global are its societal effects.
en-000005647	In 1888, Brazil became the last country in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery.
en-000005648	The move was opposed by Brazilian elites, and they led a successful "coup d'état" in 1889.
en-000005649	Social conditions in the Brazilian Navy, however, were not keeping pace with the new technology.
en-000005650	In response, sailors used the new warships for a carefully planned and executed mutiny in November 1910.
en-000005651	In the years preceding the revolt, the Brazilian populace saw frequent changes in the country's political, economic, and social climate.
en-000005652	More broadly, African countries need to put their political and economic houses in order.
en-000005653	Contemporary writers estimated that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil.
en-000005654	Ex-slaves and the sons of slaves make up our ships'crews, most of them dark-skinned or dark-skinned mulattos.
en-000005655	Volunteers, who perhaps unsurprisingly made up a very low percentage of recruits, signed on for nine years.
en-000005656	Another point of contention came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses.
en-000005657	They rescinded the law less than a year later amid widespread noncompliance.
en-000005658	Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a "Companhia Correcional" (Correctional Company).
en-000005659	Most of the Brazilian Navy's officer core believed that corporal punishment was an essential tool in maintaining discipline on their ships.
en-000005660	The conspirators were just "waiting for a date and for power," referring to the brand-new warships.
en-000005661	A significant percentage of the naval crewmen stationed in Rio de Janeiro revolted at around 10 pm on 22 November.
en-000005662	These exceptions came on "Minas Geraes", whose officers were surprised but had time to draw their weapons and defend themselves.
en-000005663	First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government.
en-000005664	When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers.
en-000005665	The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.
en-000005666	This we ask the President of the republic and the Minister of the Navy.
en-000005667	If we do not receive such a response, we will destroy the city and the ships that are not revolting."
en-000005668	Fonseca, however, refused to allow any direct contact between himself and the mutineers.
en-000005669	Broadly speaking, however, it appears that the ships were well-handled and commanded.
en-000005670	This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.
en-000005671	The press initially stoked these peoples'fears, although they later flipped to lionizing the rebels, portraying them as heroes.
en-000005672	Fonseca and the navy's high command were faced with two extremely unpalatable choices.
en-000005673	At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels.
en-000005674	Pressed by his navy minister, Forseca did not yet give up on the military option.
en-000005675	In Congress, the influential senator and losing presidential candidate Rui Barbosa championed the rebels'cause.
en-000005676	It is not known if the rebels were warned or were simply taking defensive precautions.
en-000005677	The amnesty was passed by the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 125–23.
en-000005678	Under the threat of having a veto overridden, Fonseca signed the amnesty.
en-000005679	In the aftermath of the revolt, the two Brazilian dreadnoughts were disarmed by the removal of their guns'breechblocks.
en-000005680	Meanwhile, the decision to extend an amnesty to the mutineer sailors engendered much criticism from Brazil's upper classes.
en-000005681	Instead, enlisted men had used those very ships to humiliate the naval elite.
en-000005682	These sailors were given shore leave on the day the revolt ended (26 November).
en-000005683	Shortly after, the marine infantry battalion at the naval facilities on Ilha das Cobras revolted.
en-000005684	The vote was nearly unanimous; the only vote against came from Rui Barbosa.
en-000005685	Historians now hold that there was likely no cross-pollination between the Revolt of the Lash and these subsequent revolts.
en-000005686	Meanwhile, João Cândido—stricken by hallucinations from his traumatic night—was sentenced to a mental hospital.
en-000005687	Matt Tolfrey was born in England but raised on the small island country of Bahrain.
en-000005688	But when I was born there, in 1952, the island was poorer than almost every country in Africa.
en-000005689	Mirroring his success on the airwaves, Tolfrey also began gaining popularity around the clubscene.
en-000005690	Wanting to be involved more in the other aspects of dance music, Tolfrey dove into production work.
en-000005691	Through his enthusiasm for electronic music and interest in experimentation, Tolfrey started his own label, Leftroom in 2005.
en-000005692	Tolfrey sought after an avenue to release his peer's music and open up opportunities for friends that he believed in.
en-000005693	In 2012 Matt Tolfrey put out his first full-length album "Word of Mouth" on Leftroom Records.
en-000005694	'Word of Mouth'has since gained popular reviews from many highly respected electronic music enthusiasts.
en-000005695	In 2015, he was also featured as "Most Powerful, Successful People in the Indian Construction Industry" by Construction Sphere.
en-000005696	He started his career with PricewaterhouseCoopers and was associated with them for 4 years.
en-000005697	He traveled extensively to USA and other parts of the world during his tenure with PwC.
en-000005698	At Srei, he manages portfolio investment across the infrastructure sector– roads, ports, airports, water and economic zones.

en-000005703	Founded in Ohio in 1941, Americhem employs over 500 people worldwide.
en-000005704	On November 29, 1941, Alabama native Sylvester S. Caldwell founded The Caldwell Company in Akron, OH.
en-000005705	During World War II natural rubber became scarce due to rationing.
en-000005706	In September 1943 Caldwell Co. became incorporated, which was followed by fast growth and new customers.
en-000005707	Due to the growth, the company was relocated to its own building on Cutler Parkway while remaining in Akron, OH.
en-000005708	He was followed by Harvey E. Cooper who joined in 1958 as a chemist from Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.
en-000005709	Both men acquired equal shares of The Caldwell Company making them President and Vice President of the company.
en-000005710	On September 2, 1959 the first manufacturing plant was opened on Home Ave. in Akron, OH.
en-000005711	This was the beginning of The Caldwell Co. manufacturing its own products.
en-000005712	With the change in business operations, The Caldwell Co. quickly changed their name to Americhem Inc.
en-000005713	The newly named company began regularly producing their own products in 1960.
en-000005714	With funding from issuance of bonds, Americhem was able to develop a number of new commercial products.
en-000005715	By the end of 1964, Americhem was manufacturing color concentrates for ABS, many of which were used for the RV industry.
en-000005716	In July 1965, Americhem Headquarters was moved to a new building in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.
en-000005717	There was also an expansion with manufacturing in 1969 when a new plant was purchased in Medina, OH.
en-000005718	Also in 1969, Americhem designed and manufactured the first masterbatches for vinyl siding.
en-000005719	This marked the company’s first step into the building products industry.
en-000005720	Then in 1973, they opened their first out of state plant located in Elgin, Illinois.
en-000005721	This plant eventually became the new location of the Medina, OH plant.
en-000005722	The 1973 oil crisis devastated the automotive industry, which in turn severely affected sales at Americhem.
en-000005723	During this time, Americhem gained business in the packaging and construction industries, which led to an upturn in profits.
en-000005724	In the textiles industry, profits declined for the first time in ten years in 2008.
en-000005725	In 1974, partial owner Harvey Cooper retired, leaving ownership of Americhem Inc. to Richard Juve who became majority owner.
en-000005726	In 1978, Americhem reached a milestone when opening their first research department.
en-000005727	Americhem opened a new plant on Steels Corners Road in Cuyahoga Falls, OH in 1998”
en-000005728	A plant was opened in 2002 located in the carpet capital of the world, Dalton, Georgia.
en-000005729	This included a reimagining of the traditional logo and new company colors: navy blue and sage green.
en-000005730	Americhem implemented lighting improvements to improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce the company’s carbon footprint.
en-000005731	The seventh Americhem plant was opened in 2010 in Liberty, NC with a specialty of black, white and additive masterbatch products.
en-000005732	In 2011, Americhem Inc. celebrated their 70-year anniversary, which was recognized by the governor of Ohio and mayor of Cuyahoga Falls.
en-000005733	The Queen’s Award for Enterprise was awarded to Americhem for the second time in the category of International Trade in 2012.
en-000005734	Americhem also won the Material of the Year award from Material Connexion in NYC for their photochromatic "blushing bottles."
en-000005735	Americhem U, a series of informational seminars for customers, was introduced in 2011 and continues to this day.
en-000005736	On December 28, 2012 Americhem Inc. purchased Infinity Compounding in Swedesboro, NJ later changing their name to Americhem Infinity Engineered Compounds.
en-000005737	In 2014, the Americhem Manchester, U.K. factory was granted ISO/TS 16949 certification.
en-000005738	The Cuyahoga Falls plant received ISO 14001 environmental certification in 2014.
en-000005739	This precolor compound maker was merged with Americhem Infinity to form Infinity LTL Engineered Compounds.
en-000005740	Most of the company’s products are made for specific customers and specific applications.
en-000005741	These additives can also be made as stand-alone products, with or without color.

en-000005745	Saint-Denis is a formerly industrial suburb currently changing its economic base.
en-000005746	But changing economic balances also lead to changing political balances.
en-000005747	Until the 3rd century, Saint-Denis was a small settlement called "Catolacus" or "Catulliacum", probably meaning "estate of Catullius", a Gallo-Roman landowner.
en-000005748	About 250 AD, the first bishop of Paris, Saint Denis, was martyred on Montmartre hill and buried in "Catolacus".
en-000005749	In 1793, during the French Revolution, Saint-Denis was renamed "Franciade" in a gesture of rejection of religion.
en-000005750	In 1803, however, under the Consulate of Napoléon Bonaparte, the city reverted to its former name of Saint-Denis.
en-000005751	During its history, Saint-Denis has been closely associated with the French royal house.
en-000005752	Starting from Dagobert I (c. 603– 639), almost every French king was buried in the Basilica.
en-000005753	In the 2nd century, there was a Gallo-Roman village named "Catolacus" on the location that Saint-Denis occupies today.
en-000005754	It was this chapel that Dagobert I had rebuilt and turned into a royal monastery.
en-000005755	During the Middle Ages, because of the privileges granted by Dagobert, Saint-Denis grew to become very important.
en-000005756	Merchants from all over Europe (and indeed from the Byzantine Empire) came to visit its market.
en-000005757	In 1140, Abbot Suger, counselor to the King, granted further privileges to the citizens of Saint-Denis.
en-000005758	Saint-Denis suffered heavily in the Hundred Years'War; of its 10,000 citizens, only 3,000 remained after the war.
en-000005759	During the French Wars of Religion, the Battle of Saint-Denis was fought between Catholics and Protestants on 10 November 1567.
en-000005760	The Protestants were defeated, but the Catholic commander Anne de Montmorency was killed.
en-000005761	In 1590, the city surrendered to Henry IV, who converted to Catholicism in 1593 in the abbey of Saint-Denis.
en-000005762	King Louis XIV (1638–1715) started several industries in Saint-Denis: weaving and spinning mills and dyehouses.
en-000005763	The last king to be interred in Saint-Denis was Louis XVIII (1755 – 1824).
en-000005764	After France became a republic and an empire, Saint-Denis lost its association with royalty.
en-000005765	On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes.
en-000005766	On that occasion, the commune of La Chapelle-Saint-Denis was disbanded and divided between the city of Paris, Saint-Denis, Saint-Ouen, and Aubervilliers.
en-000005767	By the end of the century, there were 80 factories in Saint-Denis.
en-000005768	The presence of so many industries also gave rise to an important socialist movement.
en-000005769	Until Jacques Doriot in 1934, all mayors of Saint-Denis were members of the Communist Party.
en-000005770	During the Second World War, after the defeat of France, Saint-Denis was occupied by the Germans on 13 June 1940.
en-000005771	There were several acts of sabotage and strikes, most notably on 14 April 1942 at the Hotchkiss factory.
en-000005772	After an insurgency which started on 18 August 1944, Saint-Denis was liberated by General Leclerc on 27 August 1944.
en-000005773	The stadium is used by the national football and rugby teams for friendly matches.
en-000005774	In 2003, together with Paris, Saint-Denis hosted the second European Social Forum.
en-000005775	In 2016, Saint-Denis was one of the host cities of the UEFA European Football Championships, including the opening game.
en-000005776	Saint-Denis and its surrounding areas are infamous in France for their crime rate.

en-000005780	He was a candidate for the Republican nomination for president of the United States in the 2016 election.
en-000005781	Bush's ideological score on this scale was similar to that of previous Republican nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney.

en-000005795	In September 2015, Bush published a five-point cybersecurity plan that would establish a "command focus" on Internet security.
en-000005796	Bush also reiterated his support for the NSA and argued in favor of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA).
en-000005797	Privacy experts believe the proposed legislation includes loopholes which could be used to increase government surveillance.
en-000005798	In July 2015, Bush said that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden "should be given no leniency."
en-000005799	It's not a question of toughness, it's manipulating people's angst and their fears."
en-000005800	In June 2015, Bush stated that he viewed the Confederate flag as a racist symbol.
en-000005801	In December 2015, Bush said:"The problem with the Confederate flag isn't the Confederacy.
en-000005802	The problem with the Confederate flag is what it began to represent later."
en-000005803	In his unsuccessful 1994 campaign for Florida governor, Bush promised to sign many more death warrants as governor.
en-000005804	One of the "central themes" of Bush's 1994 campaign was his proposal to shorten the appeals period in capital cases.

en-000005819	Bush proposed moving the library's collection to a private university in South Florida.
en-000005820	Bush's proposal generated substantial public opposition, and was dropped after the Florida Legislature refused to support it.
en-000005821	The plan set aside over one million acres of land for conservation.
en-000005822	Michael Grunwald writes that"at best, [Bush's] legacy in the Everglades is mixed.
en-000005823	When it came to the Everglades, he did his homework, devised a plan and stuck to it."
en-000005824	In July 2008, Bush stated"had I known that gas was going to be $4.30 per gallon,...
en-000005825	I would have supported a lifting of the [drilling] moratorium with proper safeguards."

en-000005833	Bush acknowledges climate change, but has equivocated about the degree to which humans are responsible.
en-000005834	"National Journal " writes that Bush"does not acknowledge the scientific consensus that human activity drives climate change."
en-000005835	China will work for a global consensus on climate change.
en-000005836	And for the people to say the science is decided on, this is just really arrogant, to be honest with you."
en-000005837	In April 2015, Bush stated that"The climate is changing, and I'm concerned about that.
en-000005838	We need to work with the rest of the world to negotiate a way to reduce carbon emissions."
en-000005839	For inaction in the face of grave danger is another form of denial."
en-000005840	Bush stated"I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinals or my pope.

en-000005884	[W]e have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows.
en-000005885	It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families.
en-000005886	That's the only way we're going to get out of this rut that we're in.
en-000005887	Bush's tax plan has also been described as similar to the George W. Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.

en-000005911	Bush unsuccessfully pushed to privatize the State Library collection and move its collection to a private university.
en-000005912	Under this system, only one new federal hire would be made for every three federal employees who leave.
en-000005913	Bush asserted that this would cut the size of the federal workforce by 10%.
en-000005914	Why would you say that about a place where 650,000 taxpayers live—many of whom are veterans?"
en-000005915	Bush favors raising the retirement age (i.e., the age for collecting Social Security retirement benefits) "from 65 to 68 or 70."

en-000005924	Bush says that he is "an unwavering supporter" of Israel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
en-000005925	Bush later clarified that he was referring to policy on Israel, rather than on the Middle East as a whole.
en-000005926	Bush might propose more forward deployment of U.S. forces, but otherwise his Iraq policy boils down to'I'll try harder.'"
en-000005927	Bush has also called for imposing and enforcing a no-fly zone across part of Syria.
en-000005928	Bush said:"I think people were sticking their fingers in the breeze and that's wrong.
en-000005929	We should support the President because that was better than inaction.
en-000005930	And so would almost everybody that was confronted with the intelligence they got."
en-000005931	He also indicated that the lack of focus on post-invasion security was a mistake.
en-000005932	Several days later, Bush stated: "knowing what we know now,...I would not have engaged...I would not have gone into Iraq."
en-000005933	Bush has called for increased military spending, expressing the belief that 2.5% of GDP is an insufficient amount.

en-000005938	Because I don't think we need it, it's not the law."
en-000005939	I think it was appropriate—it was also appropriate to change the policies once we had enough history."
en-000005940	Bush also "said there was a difference between enhanced interrogation and torture" but declined to be specific.
en-000005941	All four states complied with the ruling the same day it was issued before the mandate was actually issued.
en-000005942	Every state in the circuit had a district court ruling against their states'ban, but they were eventually stayed pending appeal.
en-000005943	On August 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit heard oral arguments for same-sex marriage cases from each state within the circuit.
en-000005944	Recognition of same-sex relationships (marriages under that name or any other) have been banned by the state constitution since 2004.
en-000005945	The state's ban was struck down entirely on 1 July 2014 and was stayed pending appeal.
en-000005946	Michigan's state constitution bans recognition of same-sex unions in any form following a 2004 popular vote.
en-000005947	A vote for recognition of Palestinian statehood is a vote for peace.
en-000005948	Same-sex marriage in Michigan was ruled legal on March 21, 2014 by the U.S. District Court for Michigan's Eastern District.
en-000005949	On March 25, 2014, a federal appeals court stayed the ruling indefinitely.
en-000005950	The same-sex marriages that were performed that day are currently recognized.
en-000005951	The sudden stop-start motion of the game is what often leads to serious injuries in participants.
en-000005952	A soft tissue injury is the damage of muscles, ligaments or tendons in the body.
en-000005953	The most common soft tissue injuries in netball occur to the ankles, knees and hands.
en-000005954	The main cause of these injuries is due to incorrect landing.
en-000005955	Other factors influencing injury include; tripping, collisions with other players, being struck by the ball, over-exertion and fatigue.
en-000005956	In netball the ankle joint is most susceptible to injury and accounts for 31% of the injuries sustained in the sport.
en-000005957	A sprained ankle is a tear or complete rupture of a ligament.
en-000005958	This ligament is on the outside of the ankle and injury occurs when the sole of the foot rolls inwards.
en-000005959	Knee injuries are the second most common injury in netball and are the most serious in regards to cost and disability.
en-000005960	The most common knee injuries are meniscal and major ligament sprains/ruptures.
en-000005961	ACL injuries are difficult to effectively diagnose without the assistance of Medical Resonance Imaging (MRI).
en-000005962	It is essential that players seek immediate help from a qualified first aid provider or health practitioner.
en-000005963	Any netball injury should be treated by using the P.R.I.C.E.S., D.R.S.A.B.C., T.O.T.A.P.S.
en-000005964	If an injury occurs ensure that all netball players receive adequate treatment and full rehabilitation before returning to play.
en-000005965	It is essential to follow all recovery and rehabilitation programs fully to prevent any injury from re occurring.
en-000005966	In order to prevent netball injuries, essential pre-season training is required before commencing the playing season.
en-000005967	The distance travelled by elite players over a game ranges from 7 km (shooters/ defenders) to 8.8 km (centre court players).
en-000005968	It is important that fitness testing is conducted prior to competition to ensure readiness to play the game.
en-000005969	Training should consist of netball specific exercises that focus on enhancing body balance, landing control, change of direction and catching passes.
en-000005970	It is very important that children are properly taught the fundamentals of netball before they participate in game situations.
en-000005971	Any incorrect techniques should be corrected at a young age before they become a bad habit.
en-000005972	A warm-up should never be overlooked in netball as it plays a vital and effective role in preventing injury.
en-000005973	Any warm-up should consist of running, dynamic movements and dynamic stretches.
en-000005974	All courts should be a firm, smooth surfaces with no loose gravel or hazards.
en-000005975	The most important uniform item for any netball player is the shoes.
en-000005976	For many netball players a serious injury can be a traumatic life event that results in physical and psychological ramifications.
en-000005977	It is important to remember that not all injured athletes will experience the same cognitive and emotional responses.
en-000005978	The most commonly found mood disturbances are increases in depression, tension and anger.
en-000005979	The emotional response will depend on how extreme the injury is.
en-000005980	Self-efficacy is defined as one’s belief in ones ability to succeed in specific situations.
en-000005981	Most often players will be highly motivated to get back to playing netball as soon as possible.
en-000005982	However it is important to remember that injured athletes will have good and bad days.
en-000005983	It is important for athletes to have a good support network to keep them positive and focused during these harder times.
en-000005984	Physical recovery is critical, however, psychological rehabilitation is the most important part of recovery.
en-000005985	Even though a player may be physically ready to return to netball, they may not be psychologically ready to play.
en-000005986	Various doubts, fears and anxieties may surface when thinking about returning to netball.
en-000005987	This will result in the athlete putting a huge amount of pressure on themselves.
en-000005988	Achieving these goals at training will best prepare an athlete for what they will experience during competition standards.
en-000005989	It is important for the athlete to set realistic goals that they are able to achieve.
en-000005990	They must understand that these goals may need to be long term, as not everything can be achieved over night.
en-000005991	It is important that goals are flexible because when injured the rehab progress is often unpredictable.
en-000005992	Athletes that are engaged in their rehabilitation program are likely to cope with their injury more successfully.
en-000005993	It is very important to have social support during the injury, rehabilitation and sports returning phase.
en-000005994	The support of these people is essential for times when the athlete may need positive encouragement around them.
en-000005995	The athlete should talk to someone they feel most comfortable with and who is going to listen and support them.
en-000005996	It can be beneficial for an injured player to work with a sports psychologist.
en-000005997	It is important to remember that there is no rush to get back to netball.
en-000005998	It is important to take part in game play situations at training.
en-000005999	The athlete may also want to start in a lower grade then usual to help ease back into the game.
en-000006000	Hypermobility is defined as a condition in which an individual’s synovial joints have a range of motion beyond normal limits.
en-000006001	Hypermobile joints can be a performance enhancement in some sports, for example spin bowlers in cricket.
en-000006002	In any case, performance-enhancement is, Savulescu says, the very spirit of sport.
en-000006003	However some studies suggest the increased risk of joint dislocations, sprains and joint hyperextension in athletes with hypermobile joints.
en-000006004	They believe that recognising hyper mobility in young female athletes may reduce the risk of injuries occurring.
en-000006005	On the contrary, others suggest that hyper mobility is not associated with an increased incidence of injuries in junior netball players.
en-000006006	This injury ruled her out of the chance to play at the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth games.
en-000006007	Ellis said that she had to reignite her passion and love for the game that had been her life.
en-000006008	She worked extremely hard on her rehabilitation, her knee repaired and her passion was restored.
en-000006009	Ellis produced some of the best netball of her career in the two years that followed.
en-000006010	She ended her 18-year career in her 122nd test with Australia winning the world championship 42-38.
en-000006011	She overcame all critics and odds after coming back from her knee injury.
en-000006012	West Coast Fever captain, Ashleigh Brazill, ruptured the meniscus in her left knee late in the 2012 ANZ championship season.
en-000006013	Brazill had been selected to represent Australia in the Constellation Cup, but unfortunately had to withdrawal from the team.
en-000006014	Brazil worked to build the strength back in her knee and went on to resume playing in the following 2013 season.
en-000006015	In April 2015, Melbourne Vixens mid courter, Madi Robinson ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee.
en-000006016	She is on track to return to play in the 2016 season.
en-000006017	Immigration is the movement of an individual or group of peoples to a foreign country to live permanently.
en-000006018	But consider individual countries: some run a large foreign debt, while others maintain a large creditor position.
en-000006019	The reason for people or groups of peoples moving to Australia varies.
en-000006020	Immigrants are known to enter Australia both legally and illegally, and this can affect one's health immensely.
en-000006021	In 1788, the first fleet of British immigrants established a colony in Australia.
en-000006022	The immigration of European settlers introduced such bacteria and viruses to Australia.
en-000006023	1850: Measles were reported in Australia brought over by the European.
en-000006024	After the 1860s, those from Afghanistan settled in Australia establishing work in outback Australia.
en-000006025	Afghans who migrate to Australia face several disadvantages when accessing health services.
en-000006026	It is reported that the average age expectancy of an Afghan, both male and female, is 44.6 years of age.
en-000006027	Studies have also proven that Afghanistan has the fourth highest mortality rate and second highest infant mortality in the world.
en-000006028	The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne have conducted a study that identifies the following amongst children who have immigrated to Australia.
en-000006029	In the 1830s, the immigrants that arrived by boat on the shores of Sydney were suspected to be carrying contagious diseases.
en-000006030	During this period, influenza, typhoid, scarlet fever and whopping cough were all found on European ships arriving in Australia.
en-000006031	Each experience within North Head varied and was dependent on class.
en-000006032	Some immigrants were exposed to further disease, disempowerment and in some cases death.
en-000006033	In the beginning, North Head Quarantine Station provided tents for those immigrants who came to Australia.
en-000006034	As a result, an outbreak of smallpox occurred due to insufficient maintenance of the North Head Quarantine Station.
en-000006035	In order to ensure Australia's health and safety, the Government is required to examine all immigrants prior to entering Australia.
en-000006036	Those who seek either a permanent or temporary visa are part of this application.
en-000006037	All candidates are checked for Tuberculosis, HIV and Hepatitis, Yellow fever, Polio and the Ebola virus disease (EVD).
en-000006038	For those who migrate to Australia, there are many disadvantages in the way of healthcare.
en-000006039	Cultural barriers felt by immigrants include the Australians perceptions of health as well as their behaviour when sick.
en-000006040	It is also prominent that some immigrants are concerned that doctors will not recognise or understand their specific cultural needs.
en-000006041	Such examples include the needs of women from the Middle East.
en-000006042	The ABC (2015) states that"different cultural groups have specific expectations.
en-000006043	For example, Jehovah's Witness followers will refuse to have blood transfusions, believing it is polluting."
en-000006044	This could result in the individual's health deteriorating as a result of lack of attention.
en-000006045	Therefore, it is vital for immigrants, upon arrival, are noted of their rights in regards to free healthcare.
en-000006046	It has been identified that immigrants from non-English speaking backgrounds, tend to feel less empowered, resulting in the patients becoming reticent.
en-000006047	These factors can be reduced if new arrivals to Australia are aware of their rights.
en-000006048	Between 2007 and 2008, an Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights was established by the commission.
en-000006049	This charter can be applied in all health settings in Australia.
en-000006050	men have demonstrated an increased risk of mental health issues and access health services less than Australian born men.
en-000006051	The findings of this study identify the importance of social support to prevent mental health issues.
en-000006052	Whilst most immigrants and refugees travel to Australia legally, there are others who travel to Australia illegally.
en-000006053	From there, the Royal Australian Navy pass the refugees on to Australian Customs for detention.
en-000006054	Dependent on the individual and their country of origin, the degree of nutritional and infectious disease varies.
en-000006055	Dental health amongst detainees is poor with the severe cases being acknowledged and attended to within the detention centres.
en-000006056	Anxiety and stress within the facilities has been emphasised by the lack of social support, unemployment and discrimination.
en-000006057	This psychological stress felt by detainees can be enhanced by the confined environment of the detention camps.
en-000006058	Amongst the men and women, children have also been reported for suffering prolonged psychological conditions.
en-000006059	Nevertheless, there is a competing principle to afford every immigrant and Australian citizen an equal opportunity to uphold their cultural beliefs.
en-000006060	In 1992, mandatory detention was introduced for refugees and asylum seekers entering Australia illegally.
en-000006061	Philip Flood, the former Secretory of the Department of Foreign Affairs, undertook an investigation into mandatory detention.
en-000006062	Several circumstances of self-harm, psychiatric problems and sexual, verbal and physical abuse of children were documented by Flood.
en-000006063	This debate against mandatory detention identifies the negatives and prolonged health issues that can arise from long-term detention.
en-000006064	granted a bridging visa whilst waiting for their refugee status to be determined.
en-000006065	Those authorised officers within immigration detention centres are given the power to use force against asylum seekers and refugees.
en-000006066	This is stated within the 2015 bill to maintain good order of immigration facilities.
en-000006067	The Australian Human Rights Commission recognises the environment of particular detention facilities and force may be essential in specific circumstances.
en-000006068	The issue of children in immigration detention facilities is of high importance and is therefore a controversial topic.
en-000006069	Ultimately, after the regular army entered Ouagadougou to confront the RSP, Kafando was restored as President on 23 September 2015.
en-000006070	The report, submitted to Prime Minister Zida, described the RSP as "an army within an army".
en-000006071	After hundreds of protesters assembled outside of the presidential palace, soldiers fired warning shots to disperse them.
en-000006072	Some were beaten back using batons, and gunfire was reported in the Ouaga 2000 neighborhood.
en-000006073	Slogans such as "Down with the RSP" and "We want elections" were chanted by the protesters.
en-000006074	In response to the coup, about 20 French soldiers from an intelligence gathering unit were deployed to Ouagadougou.
en-000006075	We are committed to dialogue and accept certain principles of the international community."
en-000006076	The international community must therefore accept the need for a fundamental link between such military action and the UN.
en-000006077	He also promised that the exclusionary electoral law would be changed so that all political forces could participate.
en-000006078	On 18 September 2015, Diendéré said that Kafando had been released and Zida was under house arrest.
en-000006079	The country's borders, which had been closed after the coup, were reopened.
en-000006080	On the same day, the African Union suspended Burkina Faso and placed sanctions on the coup leaders.
en-000006081	Following further talks on 19 September, Boni Yayi said that "good news" would be announced the next day.
en-000006082	On 20 September, supporters of the coup violently burst into the lobby of the hotel where the talks were being held.
en-000006083	It also allowed a delay in the holding of the election, but required that it be held by 22 November.
en-000006084	He said that the crisis could lead to "chaos, civil war, and massive human rights violations" if not resolved peacefully.
en-000006085	Soldiers from the regular army entered Ouagadougou later on 21 September, facing no resistance from the RSP.
en-000006086	The army reportedly began negotiating with the RSP after reaching Ouagadougou.
en-000006087	The regular army issued an ultimatum to the RSP to surrender by the morning of 22 September.
en-000006088	Diendéré warned that the RSP would defend itself if necessary but stressed that he wanted a peaceful resolution.
en-000006089	The army's deadline for the RSP to surrender passed without fighting as negotiations continued between the two sides.
en-000006090	ECOWAS leaders planned to travel to Ouagadougou on 23 September for Kafando's restoration as President.
en-000006091	Kafando was reinstalled as President at a ceremony on 23 September in the presence of ECOWAS leaders.
en-000006092	Zida said that he foresaw a delay of "several weeks" in the holding of the election.
en-000006093	Eleven people died, and more than 250 were injured during the coup.
en-000006094	A commission was created to identify those involved in the coup and given thirty days to report.
en-000006095	On 25 September the Regiment of Presidential Security was disbanded by government decree, as recommended shortly before the coup.
en-000006096	On 26 September the assets of Diendéré and others associated with the coup were frozen by the state prosecutor.
en-000006097	Each side accused the other of acting belligerently during the process.
en-000006098	Colonel Sidi Paré, who had served under the transitional government as Minister-Delegate for Security, was reportedly arrested on 6 October.
en-000006099	Another politician, CDP Vice-President Achille Tapsoba, was arrested on 8 October.
en-000006100	Diendéré was charged with 11 crimes, including "crimes against humanity", and Bassolé was charged with six.
en-000006101	Sangare said that defendants convicted of murder could potentially be executed.
en-000006102	The Board exercises oversight over 197 public school districts and 20 educational service districts.
en-000006103	Legislators need to educate themselves – and the public – and exercise more oversight.
en-000006104	In 1859, Oregon's state constitution created a school system and designated the Governor as Superintendent of Public Instruction.
en-000006105	Access to medical care remains beyond the reach of many Malagasy.
en-000006106	14.6 percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector.
en-000006107	Approximately 70% of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30% originated with international donors and other private sources.
en-000006108	The government provides at least one basic health center per commune.
en-000006109	Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.
en-000006110	Despite these barriers to access, health services have shown a trend toward improvement over the past twenty years.
en-000006111	The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6 children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990.
en-000006112	Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8% in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth.
en-000006113	The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births, with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births.
en-000006114	Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67 years for women.
en-000006115	And it is the second worst for women, more than five years below life expectancy in Japan.
en-000006116	The bank is under process of raising paid-up capital to 4.70 billion by acquiring International Leasing and Finance Company Limited.
en-000006117	The bank's shares are publicly traded as an'A'category company in the Nepal Stock Exchange.
en-000006118	Through these correspondents the bank is able to provide services in any major currencies in the world.
en-000006119	While traditional service industries are able to provide jobs, they do not generate much income.
en-000006120	The bank also maintains its extension offices Middle East to assist in the remittance of funds from overseas Nepalese workers.
en-000006121	These services are soon to be expanded to South Korea after acquisition of International Leasing and Finance Company Limited.
en-000006122	Civil Bank Limited is now operating 42 branches and several branch-less banking counters spread throughout Nepal.
en-000006123	The bank also operates 33 ATMs throughout the country strategically placed for the convenience of customers.
en-000006124	It focuses on the smuggling of coffee, at the time an expensive luxury, into Germany.
en-000006125	That credibility will take time to recover – and time is a luxury that Brazil does not have.
en-000006126	It is also known by the alternative title of Illegal Border.
en-000006127	T. Inglis Moore (1901-1978) was an Australian writer, anthologist and academic who was born in Camden, New South Wales.
en-000006128	in 1923, graduating with first-class honours in English, history and philosophy.
en-000006129	For most of our recent history, we saw in Marxism only a philosophy of class struggle.
en-000006130	Moore taught in universities in Iowa and the Philippines before returning to Sydney in 1931, where he taught at the university.
en-000006131	After the war he taught at Canberra University College, which was later amalgamated with the Australian National University.
en-000006132	He was promoted to associate professor in 1959, and retired in 1966.
en-000006133	Research was conducted after Zambia reopened an old debate on a lending rate ceiling for banks and other financial institutions.
en-000006134	He found broadly there were four components to the interest rate:-
en-000006135	For a commercial bank or deposit taking microfinance institutions this is usually the interest that it gives on deposits.
en-000006136	Overheads can vary significantly between lenders and measuring overheads as a ratio of loans made is an indicator of institutional efficiency.
en-000006137	Lenders must absorb the cost of bad debts and write them off in the rate that they charge.
en-000006138	Lenders will include a profit margin that again varies considerably between institutions.
en-000006139	Banks and commercial MFIs with shareholders to satisfy are under greater pressure to make profits than NGO or not-for-profit MFIs.
en-000006140	Aggressive collection practices for non-payment of loans have exacerbated the image of certain lenders.
en-000006141	When making a credit decision, a bank or a microfinance institution cannot fully identify a client’s potential for repayment.
en-000006142	In between, smaller commercial banks can find a niche serving medium to large enterprises.
en-000006143	Inevitably the missing middle, individuals and businesses will be unable to access credit from either banks or MFIs.
en-000006144	Transaction costs make larger loans relatively more cost effective for the financial institution.
en-000006145	This cost pushes the higher rates of lending on smaller loans.
en-000006146	The researcher thinks such thinking ignores the actions of the banks and MFIs operating under asymmetric information.
en-000006147	- Increased lending, meaning lending to more bad clients and pushing up NPLs
en-000006148	- Increased investment in processing systems to better identify good clients, increasing overheads
en-000006149	- Increased investment in outreach to clients, identified as having good repayment potential, increasing overheads
en-000006150	The researcher asks if the story of interest rate caps leading to credit rationing is borne out in reality?
en-000006151	Though conceptually simple, there is much variation in the methodologies used by governments to implement limits on lending rates.
en-000006152	The most simple interest rate control puts an upper limit on any loans from formal institutions.
en-000006153	The logic for such a variable cap is that it can bite at various levels of the market, minimising consumer surplus.
en-000006154	Other governments have attempted to set different caps for different forms of lending instrument.
en-000006155	This counters the financial outreach agenda prevalent in many poor countries today.
en-000006156	He claims the debate boils down to the prioritisation of cost of credit over access to credit.
en-000006157	In Bolivia, the imposition of a lending cap led to a notable fall in the licensing of new entities,.
en-000006158	It was a variable cap that discriminated between eight types of lending instrument to ensure the cap bit at different levels.
en-000006159	There has been some attempt to link this constraint in the availability of credit to output.
en-000006160	In Bangladesh, firms with access to credit were found to be more efficient than firms with a credit constraint.
en-000006161	The World Bank found credit constraints may reduce profit margins buy up to 13.6% per year.
en-000006162	Their data is interesting for international comparison, but tell us relatively little about efficiency of individual companies and markets.
en-000006163	The researcher mentions profitability as there is some evidence of MFIs generating very high profits from microfinance clients.
en-000006164	Compartamos had been accused of immoral money lending (usury), charging clients annualised rates in excess of 85%.
en-000006165	He proposes that while the international comparison is interesting, it also has practical implications.
en-000006166	It provides policymakers with a conceptual framework with which to assess the appropriateness of intervention in credit markets.
en-000006167	Indeed, there are a number of other methods available that can contribute to a reduction in interest rates.
en-000006168	However it is not certain that more players means greater competition.
en-000006169	More established businesses should also be able to renegotiate and source cheaper funds, again bringing down costs.
en-000006170	For example, government investment in credit reference bureaus and collateral agencies decreases the costs of loan appraisal for banks and MFIs.
en-000006171	In the last few years, 30-40% of bank credits went to government infrastructure projects.
en-000006172	The researcher states that Government can help to push down interest rates by promoting transparency and financial consumer protection.
en-000006173	Investment in financial literacy can strengthen the voice of the borrower and protect against possible exploitation.
en-000006174	Forcing regulated financial institutions to be transparent in their lending practices means that consumers are protected from hidden costs.
en-000006175	Government can publish and advertise lending rates of competing banks to increase competition.
en-000006176	The researcher concludes that there are situations when an interest rate cap may be a good policy decision for governments.
en-000006177	This is because they address the symptom, not the cause of financial market failures.
en-000006178	It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 8 June 2012.
en-000006179	Both facilities were used for the isolation of Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and South Sea Islander patients or inmates.
en-000006180	The trustees were the Under Secretary of the Home Department (WJ Gall) and the Chief Protector of Aboriginals (JW Bleakley).
en-000006181	Apart from a well, fires had destroyed any other infrastructure and the island was unoccupied by 1925.
en-000006182	A lock hospital enforced isolation to prevent the spread of STIs.
en-000006183	During the first decade of the 20th century a number of developments in the diagnosis and treatment of STIs occurred.
en-000006184	In the following year the Wassermann test for identification of the syphilis infection was created.
en-000006185	The idea of creating island lock hospitals for Aboriginal people with STIs arose in the first decade of the 20th century.
en-000006186	This concept of isolation and control of Aboriginal people was already accepted as Queensland's method of dealing with the Aboriginal population.
en-000006187	In 1895 Archibald Meston provided the Queensland Government with a plan for the welfare and protection of the colony's Aboriginal people.
en-000006188	Meston contended the reason earlier reserves operated by missionaries and others had been unsuccessful all over Australia was poor management.
en-000006189	The realities of "living under the Act" were to profoundly impact upon the lives of Queensland's Aboriginal people.
en-000006190	Bacteriological testing was not applied to non-European suspected STI cases; clinical diagnosis was deemed sufficient.
en-000006191	The tropical disease of yaws, which caused skin lesions and produced a positive Wasserman reaction, could also be mistaken for syphilis.
en-000006192	Penicillin was introduced for the treatment of gonorrhoea in 1943 but was only generally available from 1944.
en-000006193	The latter enabled the incarceration of people at the Fantome Island lock hospital for non-medical reasons.
en-000006194	The Palm Island settlement had opened in 1918 after a cyclone destroyed the Hull River settlement (established 1914) on the mainland.
en-000006195	This allowed the medical officer on Palm Island to also treat the Fantome Island inmates.
en-000006196	However, a cyclone in February 1927 caused serious damage, delaying the completion of the hospital's other buildings by Palm Island workers.
en-000006197	The lock hospital was completed and equipped by December 1927 and the first patients arrived in early 1928.
en-000006198	A vegetable garden was cultivated to supplement food supplies and provide "some light occupation for the convalescents".
en-000006199	The sea also provided additions to the diet, including fish, crabs, oysters and turtles.
en-000006200	He was knighted in 1935 and later wrote Queensland's official centennial history "Triumph in the Tropics".
en-000006201	However, the year had a high death rate amongst patients- 28 people, representing 13.65% of the total population under treatment.
en-000006202	Palm Island went a step further than other reserves by removing people from the mainland.
en-000006203	In 1933 Cilento reported that the health of Aboriginal people in North Queensland was poor and that they were undernourished.
en-000006204	By 1934 there were 40 patients dispersed in villages, and these were being fenced, along with agricultural land.
en-000006205	Three acres of upland rice was planted, and horses and pigs were brought to Fantome Island.
en-000006206	The first rice crop had failed, but the dairy herd continued to increase.
en-000006207	Despite the building programme the death rate for the lock hospital's patients remained high.
en-000006208	Causes of death recorded included tuberculosis, chronic VD, pneumonia, influenza and heart disease.
en-000006209	In 1936 vegetables and fruit trees were being grown on the island.
en-000006210	The search for a lazaret site in northern Queensland followed a succession of other attempts to segregate Hansen's disease patients.
en-000006211	The first case of Hansen's disease in Queensland had been discovered in 1855.
en-000006212	Peel Island had briefly been used to house Queensland's first female European with Hansen's disease, between 1896 and 1898.
en-000006213	The new lazaret on Peel Island, opened in 1907, was designed and organised on the principle of isolation.
en-000006214	Patients were housed in individual huts grouped in three separate compounds- male, female and "coloured".
en-000006215	The durability of the bark cladding was short-lived, and in 1909 the huts were reclad with corrugated galvanised iron.
en-000006216	However, the Queensland Government eventually abandoned the idea of housing non-European patients on Peel Island.
en-000006217	Cilento had been pushing for a segregated lazaret from the early 1930s.
en-000006218	By 21 September 1939 twelve huts were erected, with six already occupied by Hansen's disease patients from North Queensland.
en-000006219	In December 1939 the laboratory was completed, but the hospital ward building was not.
en-000006220	They were accompanied by three policemen, plus a wardsman and Matron Avonia O'Brien from Peel Island.
en-000006221	By February 1940, using Fantome Island labour, 24 huts were completed.
en-000006222	Initially, male and female patients were not segregated, much to the nun's dismay, but later separate male and female compounds existed.
en-000006223	Dr David William Johnson, the Medical Officer at Peel Island, visited Fantome in mid March 1940.
en-000006224	The 12 cows on Fantome Island were producing fresh milk for the lock hospital, but not the lazaret.
en-000006225	However, Johnson noted that Courtney had no previous experience in leprosy, and further regular visits from medical officers were desirable.
en-000006226	Whether through poor diet or lack of medical attention, the patients at the lazaret suffered a high death rate during 1940.
en-000006227	Total deaths at the lock hospital were even higher than those at the lazaret.
en-000006228	In the period between 1940 and 1945, the lock hospital's population ranged between 190 and 214 patients.
en-000006229	While Cilento was unhappy with the lack of medical expertise on Fantome Island, water was another ongoing cause for concern.
en-000006230	By October 1940 the water supply for the lock hospital was from two wells.
en-000006231	Whenever drought conditions occurred on the island, water supplies ran very low, and this problem continued into the 1950s.
en-000006232	Along with efforts to meet the patients'physical needs, attempts were made to meet their spiritual needs.
en-000006233	A Catholic Church and presbytery at the lazaret, first approved in 1940, were proceeded with from mid 1944.
en-000006234	To reflect the dual use of Fantome Island, in September 1941 it was divided into two reserves.
en-000006235	The Anglican Church was located adjacent to the southern set of huts.
en-000006236	By March 1945 many buildings on Fantome Island urgently required repair.
en-000006237	The syphilis cases were mostly in a non-infectious stage, and could be returned to the settlements, with weekly injections.
en-000006238	After World War II there was a burst of building activity at the Fantome Island Lazaret.
en-000006239	By October 1946 a visitors'quarters was under construction and another 10,000 gallon water tank was provided by June 1947.
en-000006240	By June 1948 radio communication with Palm Island was installed, along with a 16 mm movie plant for entertainment of the patients.
en-000006241	By September 1946 there were 38 women in 15 huts, when there were supposed to be two people per hut.
en-000006242	The skillion-roofed 12'by 15'(3.7 m by 4.6 m) huts were also uninhabitable in heavy rain.
en-000006243	As the wall framing was on the outside of the fibro sheeting, water easily penetrated the structures.
en-000006244	"After all, these unfortunates are human beings and entitled to a reasonable standard of comforts the same as whites".
en-000006245	A total of 27 huts of the new design, including six for married couples, were approved by Cabinet in June 1947.
en-000006246	Although attempts to improve patient accommodation on Fantome Island failed, medical advances were occurring in the treatment of Hansen's disease.
en-000006247	The drug sulphetrone was introduced at Fantome Island in December 1948 in the treatment of 40 selected cases.
en-000006248	In July 1949 it was reported that sulphetrone had "already resulted in a remarkable improvement among patients" on Fantome Island.
en-000006249	Fantome Island was singled out by the Australian Leprosy Campaign Committee.
en-000006250	He added that the diet was so bad that patients were unable to assimilate the meagre medical treatment given.
en-000006251	Gladen also claimed that administrative neglect on Fantome Island had resulted in 80 deaths in 10 years and only five cures.
en-000006252	His claims about clinical records and diet were rejected by the DHHA, which stated that Gladen had never visited Fantome Island.
en-000006253	Another organisation critical of the treatment of Fantome Island patients was the Relatives and Friends Association.
en-000006254	In April 1951 the population of the Fantome Island Lazaret was 70 patients and six nuns.
en-000006255	EH Hinton, the Honorary Secretary of the Relatives and Friends Association, visited Fantome Island on 12 December 1951.
en-000006256	He concluded that the facility should be moved to Kenmore near Brisbane.
en-000006257	Dr Gabriel, Acting Medical Superintendent, denied the accusations, although he did note that the visiting situation could be improved.
en-000006258	He recommended trialling some patients on dapsone, and others on thioacetazone.
en-000006259	There were 10 women in the female compound, and 35 men and 10 married couples in the male compound.
en-000006260	The ceilings of the huts were still unlined at the time of Gabriel's visit, with recently renewed roofs.
en-000006261	"Much information was sought from me concerning the white patients at Peel Island?
en-000006262	I replied as truthfully as I could without drawing attention to the rather different requirement of white and coloured patients".
en-000006263	Two Braithwaite pressed steel 100,000 gallon (454,609 litre) water tanks were erected, on concrete bases, over 1951-52.
en-000006264	An electrical system was close to completion by June 1953, at which time there were 60 patients.
en-000006265	Converters had to be brought in to provide AC power to the picture theatre, radio telephone and public address system.
en-000006266	Only governments can provide public goods and address social challenges on a national scale.
en-000006267	At this time a home for ex-Hansen's disease patients was being built on Palm Island.
en-000006268	He also claimed that some visiting nuns were refused a boat ride to Fantome Island from Palm Island.
en-000006269	The huts, which by now had caneite ceilings, were suffering from rot and white ants.
en-000006270	At this time there were 12 patients on Fantome Island, including nine readmissions.
en-000006271	Bowler argued that, with regard to the treatment of patients as individuals, Fantome Island was a disgrace.
en-000006272	The patients were reportedly reluctant to move, as they feared a loss of freedom on Palm Island.
en-000006273	However, the lazaret closed on 3 August 1973 and in mid August the complex was burnt by the Health Department.
en-000006274	The two large Braithwaite steel water tanks were disassembled in 1974 and taken to Townsville.
en-000006275	The island is currently uninhabited, although there is some evidence of recent camping.
en-000006276	The archaeological remains of the sites have been interpreted according to historical research conducted prior to the site visit.
en-000006277	The two sides of the low saddle area are connected by the main lazaret pathway.
en-000006278	On the hill north of the men's quarters are the remains of two reservoirs and the overseer's house (Figure 3).
en-000006279	A pathway traverses the island in the low saddle area of the lazaret.
en-000006280	The remains of St Mary's Catholic Church are located adjacent to and immediately west of the main lazaret pathway.
en-000006281	The plinth features a shallow arched recess on each side with a Christian cross motif.
en-000006282	A recent plaque sits on the plinth and is dated 31 May 2010.
en-000006283	Presbytery Immediately west of the church remnants are the scattered remains of the presbytery.
en-000006284	An overgrown garden of exotic flowering plants is on the western side of the presbytery.
en-000006285	The remains of the lazaret hospital are located 53 m west of the main lazaret pathway.
en-000006286	The beginning of the complex is marked by a low dry stone and coral wall extending perpendicular to the beach front.
en-000006287	At the rear of the hospital complex are two concrete pads.
en-000006288	One pad contains the remains of a stove, fridge, and concrete wash tub.
en-000006289	These pads are possibly remnants of the hospital laundry and medical sample collection site.
en-000006290	The area is covered by building debris particularly asbestos fibro fragments.
en-000006291	The most intact remains are those associated with the nuns'changing rooms.
en-000006292	The site is marked by a concrete pad which is recessed into the ground, with raised concrete surrounds.
en-000006293	Internal spaces can be read through the presence of the bases of room dividers, marked by concrete strips.
en-000006294	Two iron bath tubs are situated side by side in the centre of the floor area.
en-000006295	An iron pipe runs from this tank and parallel to the beach front towards a second set of concrete pads.
en-000006296	These pads contain the remains of an iron stove and system of concrete spoon drains.
en-000006297	A small solid roofed structure constructed entirely of cement is located adjacent to these remains.
en-000006298	It has a doorway (the door itself is missing) but no windows.
en-000006299	Its function is unclear but internal wall markings suggest use as either a meat locker/safe or possibly a fumigation shed.
en-000006300	The remains of the visitors'quarters are located immediately east of the sisters'quarters.
en-000006301	A set of three concrete stairs survives leading up into what was once the western end of the former structure.
en-000006302	Located east of the visitors'quarters are the remains of the grotto.
en-000006303	The grotto contains a large shrine consisting of a tall mound of local stone.
en-000006304	The shrine features a statuary platform close to the apex though a statue is no longer present.
en-000006305	The face of the altar is marked with three arched shallow recesses.
en-000006306	The largest central arch features a rough outline of Australia that has been constructed of small shells applied to the surface.
en-000006307	The path to the grotto terminates at the site of a small steep pyramid-shaped shrine constructed of stone.
en-000006308	The shrine has a flat concreted top section probably for a statue, though a statue is no longer present.

en-000006568	A zoonosis may be defined as any disease and/or infection which is naturally transmissible between animals and man.
en-000006569	The picture in developed and developing countries may be quite different as far as zoonoses are concerned.
en-000006570	Most importantly, both developing and developed countries need to abandon inflation targeting.
en-000006571	All countries – both developed and developing – have been losing billions of dollars in tax revenues.
en-000006572	Despite this food borne disease is still a big problem in developed countries.
en-000006573	Environmental pollutants that arise through the keeping and use of animals may include pollution of the air, land or water.

en-000006577	Carmody was born at Malvern, a suburb of Melbourne, in Victoria.
en-000006578	Carmody enlisted in 1940 in the Citizen Air Force of the Royal Australian Air Force.
en-000006579	He was commissioned in February 1943, serving as a radar officer and was demobbed in 1945.
en-000006580	In 1977, Carmody was appointed a Knight Bachelor in recognition of service to the public service.
en-000006581	It is critically important that public services, public investment, and public policy are well managed.
en-000006582	In 2008, a street in the Canberra suburb of Casey was named Carmody Street in Alan Carmody's honour.
en-000006583	A practising Catholic, Carmody married Elizabeth Mary Brennan in St Patrick's Catholic Church, Adelaide, on 25 October 1944.
en-000006584	After a service at St Christopher's Cathedral, he was interred in Canberra.

en-000006592	Immediately after the earthquake, the active reactors automatically shut down their sustained fission reactions.
en-000006593	The insufficient cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns and the release of radioactive material beginning on 12 March.
en-000006594	Several hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred between 12 March and 15 March.
en-000006595	There are no clear plans for decommissioning the plant, but the plant management estimate is 30 or 40 years.
en-000006596	A frozen soil barrier is being constructed to prevent ongoing exposure of running groundwater with melted-down nuclear fuel.
en-000006597	These operated nominally until the tsunami destroyed the generators for reactors 1–5.
en-000006598	Water quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed.
en-000006599	The flooded diesel generators failed soon afterwards, resulting in a loss of power to the critical coolant water pumps.
en-000006600	In each case, the hydrogen-air explosions occurred at the top of each unit, that was in their upper secondary containment buildings.
en-000006601	In 2015, the number of thyroid cancers or detections of developing thyroid cancers numbered 137.
en-000006602	The report also found that the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant was incapable of withstanding the earthquake and tsunami.
en-000006603	There are no clear plans for decommissioning the plant, but the plant management estimate is thirty or forty years.
en-000006604	A frozen soil barrier is being constructed in order to prevent ongoing exposure of running groundwater with melted down nuclear fuel.
en-000006605	It was the first GE-designed nuclear plant to be constructed and run entirely by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).
en-000006606	Reactor 1 is a 439 MWe type (BWR-3) reactor constructed in July 1967, and commenced operation on 26 March 1971.
en-000006607	Reactor 2 commenced operation in July 1974, and Reactor 3 in March 1976.
en-000006608	The earthquake design basis for all units ranged from 0.42 g (4.12 m/s) to 0.46 g (4.52 m/s).
en-000006609	Units 1–5 have a Mark-1 type (light bulb torus) containment structure; unit 6 has Mark 2-type (over/under) containment structure.
en-000006610	In September 2010, Reactor 3 was partially fueled by mixed-oxides (MOX).
en-000006611	At the time of the accident, the units and central storage facility contained the following numbers of fuel assemblies:
en-000006612	There is no MOX fuel in any of the cooling ponds.
en-000006613	The only MOX fuel is loaded in the Unit 3 reactor.
en-000006614	Nuclear reactors generate electricity by using the heat of the fission reaction to create steam.
en-000006615	In the reactor core, high-pressure systems cycle water between the reactor pressure vessel and heat exchangers.
en-000006616	Some electrical power was needed to operate valves and monitoring systems.
en-000006617	Unit 1 was equipped with a different, entirely passive cooling system, the "Isolation Condenser" ("IC").
en-000006618	It consisted of a series of pipes run from the reactor core to the inside of a large tank of water.
en-000006619	For unknown reasons, Unit 1's IC was operated only intermittently during the emergency.
en-000006620	On 16 April 2011, TEPCO declared that cooling systems for Units 1-4 were beyond repair.
en-000006621	Two emergency diesel generators were available for each of units 1–5 and three for unit 6.
en-000006622	The switching station for Unit 6 was protected inside the only GE Mark II reactor building and continued to function.
en-000006623	All three of the generators added in the late 1990s were operational after the tsunami.
en-000006624	Mid-level engineers expressed concerns that this left them vulnerable to flooding.
en-000006625	However, it had incorporated design changes that improved its resistance to flooding, reducing flood damage.
en-000006626	Seawater pumps for cooling were protected from flooding, and although 3 of 4 initially failed, they were restored to operation.
en-000006627	Used fuel assemblies taken from reactors are initially stored for at least 18 months in the pools adjacent to their reactors.
en-000006628	They can then be transferred to the central fuel storage pond.
en-000006629	After further cooling, fuel can be transferred to dry cask storage, which has shown no signs of abnormalities.
en-000006630	Many of the internal components and fuel assembly cladding are made from zircaloy because it is relatively transparent to neutrons.
en-000006631	However, above 1200 degrees Celsius, zirconium metal can react exothermically with water to form free hydrogen gas.
en-000006632	The reaction between zirconium and the coolant produces more heat, accelerating the reaction.
en-000006633	In addition zircaloy can react with uranium dioxide to form zirconium dioxide and uranium metal.
en-000006634	The original plans separated the piping systems for two reactors in the isolation condenser from each other.
en-000006635	However, the application for approval of the construction plan showed the two piping systems connected outside the reactor.
en-000006636	But the condenser did not function properly and TEPCO could not confirm whether a valve was opened.
en-000006637	On 30 October 1991, one of two backup generators of Reactor 1 failed, after flooding in the reactor's basement.
en-000006638	An engineer was quoted as saying that he informed his superiors of the possibility that a tsunami could damage the generators.
en-000006639	TEPCO installed doors to prevent water from leaking into the generator rooms.
en-000006640	One of the two power sources was completely submerged, but its drive mechanism had remained unaffected.
en-000006641	In 2007, TEPCO set up a department to supervise its nuclear facilities.
en-000006642	Until June 2011 its chairman was Masao Yoshida, the Fukushima Daiichi chief.
en-000006643	A 2008 in-house study identified an immediate need to better protect the facility from flooding by seawater.
en-000006644	Headquarters officials insisted that such a risk was unrealistic and did not take the prediction seriously.
en-000006645	Japan, like the rest of the Pacific Rim, is in an active seismic zone, prone to earthquakes.
en-000006646	The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had expressed concern about the ability of Japan's nuclear plants to withstand earthquakes.
en-000006647	It produced maximum ground g-forces of 0.56, 0.52, 0.56 (5.50, 5.07 and 5.48 m/s) at units 2, 3 and 5 respectively.
en-000006648	The shock values were within the design tolerances at units 1, 4 and 6.
en-000006649	Power for the plant's control systems switched to batteries designed to provide power for about eight hours.
en-000006650	Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made to connect portable generating equipment to power water pumps.
en-000006651	The failure was attributed to flooding at the connection point in the Turbine Hall basement and the absence of suitable cables.
en-000006652	TEPCO switched its efforts to installing new lines from the grid.
en-000006653	On day one, an estimated 170,000 people were evacuated from the prohibited access and on-alert areas.
en-000006654	Prime Minister Kan instructed people within the on-alert area to leave and urged those in the prepared area to stay indoors.
en-000006655	The 20 kilometer exclusion zone was guarded by roadblocks to ensure that fewer people would be affected by the radiation.
en-000006656	The earthquake and tsunami damaged or destroyed more than one million buildings leading to a total of 470,000 people needing evacuation.
en-000006657	Of the 470,000, the nuclear accident was responsible for 154,000 being evacuated.
en-000006658	As of March 2016, of the original 470,000 evacuees, 174,000 evacuees remain.
en-000006659	In Reactors 1, 2 and 3, overheating caused a reaction between the water and the zircaloy, creating hydrogen gas.
en-000006660	On 14 March, a similar explosion occurred in the Reactor 3 building, blowing off the roof and injuring eleven people.
en-000006661	On the 15th, there was an explosion in the Reactor 2 building due to a shared vent pipe with Reactor 3.
en-000006662	For Unit 2 and Unit 3 it was estimated that the "fuel is cooled sufficiently".
en-000006663	In February 2015, TEPCO started the "Muon scanning" process for Units 1, 2 and 3.
en-000006664	It was reported that water in the spent fuel pool might be boiling.
en-000006665	Radiation inside the Unit 4 control room prevented workers from staying there for long periods.
en-000006666	Visual inspection of the spent fuel pool on 30 April revealed no significant damage to the rods.
en-000006667	A radiochemical examination of the pond water confirmed that little of the fuel had been damaged.
en-000006668	Reactors 5 and 6 were also not operating when the earthquake struck.
en-000006669	The reactors had been closely monitored, as cooling processes were not functioning well.
en-000006670	On 21 March, temperatures in the fuel pond had risen slightly, to 61 °C and water was sprayed over the pool.
en-000006671	Power was restored to cooling systems on 24 March and by 28 March, temperatures were reported down to 35 °C.
en-000006672	Trace amounts of radioactivity, including iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137, were widely observed.
en-000006673	It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima.
en-000006674	On 12 March, radioactive releases first reached a CTBTO monitoring station in Takasaki, Japan, around 200 km away.
en-000006675	The radioactive isotopes appeared in eastern Russia on 14 March and the west coast of the United States two days later.
en-000006676	By day 15, traces of radioactivity were detectable all across the northern hemisphere.
en-000006677	Within one month, radioactive particles were noted by CTBTO stations in the southern hemisphere.
en-000006678	Estimates of radioactivity released ranged from 10-40% of that of Chernobyl's.
en-000006679	On 21 March, the first restrictions were placed on the distribution and consumption of contaminated items.
en-000006680	A Fukushima-produced rice market in Tokyo was accepted by consumers as safe.
en-000006681	In 2011, scientists working for the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Kyoto University and other
en-000006682	The company had calculated only the direct releases into the sea.
en-000006683	The new calculations incorporated the portion of airborne radioactive substances that entered the ocean as rain.
en-000006684	In the first half of September 2011, TEPCO estimated the radioactivity release at some 200 MBq (megabecquerels, 5.4 millicuries) per hour.
en-000006685	Traces of iodine-131 were detected in several Japanese prefectures in November and December 2011.
en-000006686	This emission represents the most important individual oceanic emissions of artificial radioactivity ever observed.
en-000006687	The Fukushima coast has one of the world's strongest currents (Kuroshio Current).
en-000006688	It transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, dispersing the radioactivity.
en-000006689	The possible presence of other radioactive substances, such as strontium-90 or plutonium, has not been sufficiently studied.
en-000006690	Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the Fukushima coast.
en-000006691	Migratory pelagic species are highly effective and rapid transporters of radioactivity throughout the ocean.
en-000006692	Elevated levels of 134 Cs appeared in migratory species off the coast of California that were not seen pre-Fukushima.
en-000006693	As of March 2012, no cases of radiation-related ailments had been reported.
en-000006694	Experts cautioned that data was insufficient to allow conclusions on health impacts.
en-000006695	In May 2012, TEPCO released their estimate of cumulative radioactivity releases.
en-000006696	TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released "into the atmosphere in March last year [2011] alone".
en-000006697	As of October 2012, radioactivity was still leaking into the ocean.
en-000006698	On 26 October 2012, TEPCO admitted that it could not stop radioactive material entering the ocean, although emission rates had stabilized.
en-000006699	Undetected leaks could not be ruled out, because the reactor basements remained flooded.
en-000006700	Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe ordered the government to step in.
en-000006701	As of 2013, about 400 metric tons per day of cooling water was being pumped into the reactors.
en-000006702	Another 400 metric tons of groundwater was seeping into the structure.
en-000006703	Ultimately the contaminated water, after treatment to remove radionuclides other than tritium, may have to be dumped into the Pacific.
en-000006704	TEPCO intend to create an underground ice wall to reduce the rate contaminated groundwater reaches the sea.
en-000006705	A TEPCO spokesperson said that hundreds of metric tons of radioactive water had entered the ocean as a result.
en-000006706	Plastic bags filled with contaminated soil and grass were also swept away by the flood waters.
en-000006707	The common story was that the amount of radioactivity would be harmless and temporary once it arrived.
en-000006708	Government agencies and TEPCO were unprepared for the "cascading nuclear disaster".
en-000006709	The Japanese government did not keep records of key meetings during the crisis.
en-000006710	Data from the SPEEDI network were emailed to the prefectural government, but not shared with others.
en-000006711	On 14 March 2011 TEPCO officials were instructed not to use the phrase "core meltdown" at press conferences.
en-000006712	The 12.1 metre (40 ft) high tsunami that struck the plant was double the height of the highest wave predicted by officials.
en-000006713	The erroneous assumption that the plant's cooling system would function after the tsunami worsened the disaster.
en-000006714	The report said that these conflicts "produced confused flows of sometimes contradictory information".
en-000006715	The report stated that the Japanese government was slow to accept assistance from U.S. nuclear experts.
en-000006716	A 2012 report in "The Economist" said:"The operating company was poorly regulated and did not know what was going on.
en-000006717	From 17 to 19 March 2011, US military aircraft measured radiation within a 45-km radius of the site.
en-000006718	According to NSC chief Tetsuya Yamamoto, "It was very regrettable that we didn't share and utilize the information."
en-000006719	Itaru Watanabe, from the Science and Technology Policy Bureau, blamed the US for not releasing the data.
en-000006720	All residents of this village were evacuated after the government designated it a no-entry zone.
en-000006721	According to a Japanese government panel, authorities had shown no respect for the lives and dignity of village people.
en-000006722	TEPCO President Naomi Hirose told the media:"I would say it was a cover-up... It’s extremely regrettable.”
en-000006723	The incident was rated 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).
en-000006724	A 2012 analysis of the intermediate and long-lived radioactivity released found about 10-20% of that released from the Chernobyl disaster.
en-000006725	Some 500 PBq of iodine-131 were released, compared to approximately 1,760 PBq at Chernobyl.
en-000006726	Iodine-131 has a half life of 8.02 days, decaying into a stable nuclide.
en-000006727	After ten half lives (80.2 days), 99.9% has decayed to xenon-131, a stable isotope.
en-000006728	Cancer risks for fetuses were similar to those in 1 year old infants.
en-000006729	According to a linear no-threshold model (LNT model), the accident would most likely cause 130 cancer deaths.
en-000006730	In April 2014, studies confirmed the presence of radioactive tuna off the coasts of the pacific U.S.
en-000006731	Researchers carried out tests on 26 albacore tuna caught prior to the 2011 power plant disaster and those caught after.
en-000006732	However, the amount of radioactivity is less than that found naturally in a single banana.
en-000006733	As of June 2016, dispersed nuclear fallout and associated radiation contamination continue to pollute the environment.
en-000006734	The Reconstruction Agency states that 174,000 people have been unable to return to their homes.
en-000006735	Ecological diversity has decreased and malformations have been found in trees, birds, and mammals.
en-000006736	Despite this, the death rate from thyroid cancer has remained the same.
en-000006737	He described the screening results to be "20 times to 50 times what would be normally expected."
en-000006738	By the end of 2015, the number had increased to 166 children.
en-000006739	However, despite his paper being latched onto by anti-nuclear activists and widely reported by the media,
en-000006740	Wakeford's criticism was one of seven other author's letters that were published criticizing Tsuda's paper.
en-000006741	Thyroid cancer is one of the most survivable cancers, with an approximate 94% survival rate after first diagnosis.
en-000006742	That rate increases to a nearly 100% survival rate if caught early.
en-000006743	From 1989 to 2005, an excess of 4,000 children and adolescent cases of thyroid cancer were observed.
en-000006744	Nine of these had died as of 2005, a 99% survival rate.
en-000006745	In the former Soviet Union, many patients with negligible radioactive exposure after the Chernobyl disaster displayed extreme anxiety about radiation exposure.
en-000006746	They developed many psychosomatic problems, including radiophobia along with an increase in fatalistic alcoholism.
en-000006747	A survey by the Iitate local government obtained responses from approximately 1,743 evacuees within the evacuation zone.
en-000006748	The survey showed that many residents are experiencing growing frustration, instability and an inability to return to their earlier lives.
en-000006749	A total of 36.8% reported a lack of sleep, while 17.9% reported smoking or drinking more than before they evacuated.
en-000006750	Stress often manifests in physical ailments, including behavioral changes such as poor dietary choices, lack of exercise and sleep deprivation.
en-000006751	Survivors, including some who lost homes, villages and family members, were found likely to face mental health and physical challenges.
en-000006752	Much of the stress came from lack of information and from relocation.
en-000006753	In June 2011, TEPCO stated the amount of contaminated water in the complex had increased due to substantial rainfall.
en-000006754	According to reinsurer Munich Re, the private insurance industry will not be significantly affected by the disaster.
en-000006755	The amount of compensation to be paid by TEPCO is expected to reach 7 trillion yen.
en-000006756	Costs to Japanese taxpayers are likely to exceed 12 trillion yen ($100 billion).
en-000006757	According to "The Japan Times", the disaster changed the national debate over energy policy almost overnight.
en-000006758	It also omitted a section on nuclear power expansion that was in the previous year's policy review.
en-000006759	Auxiliary Bishop of Osaka Michael Goro Matsuura said this incident should cause Japan and other countries to abandon nuclear projects.
en-000006760	He called on the worldwide Christian community to support this anti-nuclear campaign.
en-000006761	Statements from Bishops'conferences in Korea and the Philippines called on their governments to abandon atomic power.
en-000006762	Author Kenzaburō Ōe, who received a Nobel prize in literature, urged Japan to abandon its reactors.

en-000006990	Restrictions have been imposed on the harvesting of peat in certain areas under relevant designations.
en-000006991	Coal remains an important solid fuel that is still used in home heating by a certain portion of households.
en-000006992	Ireland has a single coal-fired power plant at Moneypoint, Co. Clare which is operated by ESB Power Generation.
en-000006993	At 915MW output, it is one of Ireland’s largest power stations.
en-000006994	Moneypoint is considered to have a useful life until at least 2025.
en-000006995	There have been no commercial discoveries of oil in Ireland to date.
en-000006996	A Compressed air energy storage project in salt caverns near Larne has received €15m of funding from EU.
en-000006997	It is intended to provide a 250-330 MW buffer for 6-8 hours in the electricity system.
en-000006998	The Minister for Finance introduced, with effect from 1 May 2013, a solid fuel carbon tax (SFCT).
en-000006999	It applies to coal and peat and is chargeable per tonne of product.
en-000007000	The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have responsibility for the Forest Service and forestry policy in Ireland.
en-000007001	Wood is used by households that rely on solid fuels for home heating.
en-000007002	In 2014, the Department of Communications, Climate Change& Natural Resources produced a draft bioenergy strategy.
en-000007003	The current suite of measures is described in detail in Ireland’s National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) and annual reports.
en-000007004	A binding EU target for renewable energy use is also established.
en-000007005	The contribution of renewables to gross final consumption (GFC) was 8.6% in 2014.
en-000007006	This compares to a target of 16% to be achieved by 2020.
en-000007007	This avoided 3.3 million tonnes of CO2 emissions and €346 million of fossil fuel imports.
en-000007008	In fact, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels were almost 40% higher in 2008 relative to 1990.
en-000007009	Since 2003 approximately 190 wind farms, connected across 24 counties, have been installed, equating to 2,375 MW of renewable electricity capacity.
en-000007010	These wind farms have been instrumental in driving achievement of 22.7% renewable penetration by end 2014.
en-000007011	Between 200 MW and 250 MW of additional wind capacity must be installed every year to 2020.
en-000007012	Average installed capacity over the last five years has been 177 MW.
en-000007013	The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland was established as Ireland's national energy authority under the Sustainable Energy Act 2002.
en-000007014	Brazil has the world's ninth largest economy by nominal GDP, and the fifth largest by purchasing power parity.
en-000007015	After all, France is the eurozone’s second-largest economy, and the fifth-largest economy in the world.
en-000007016	The Brazilian economy is characterized by moderately free markets and an inward-oriented economy.
en-000007017	Brazil's economy is the largest of Latin America and the second largest in the Americas.
en-000007018	Brazil is a member of diverse economic organizations, such as Mercosur, Unasul, G8+5, G20, WTO, and the Cairns Group.
en-000007019	In Brazil's case, statistics show that 4.5 million people emigrated to the country between 1882 and 1934.
en-000007020	Furthermore, Brazil has at least 161,500 kilometers of paved roads and more than 93 Gigawatts of installed electric power capacity.
en-000007021	Its industrial sector accounts for three-fifths of the Latin American economy's industrial production.
en-000007022	Due to a downturn in Western economies, Brazil found itself in 2010 trying to halt the appreciation of the real.
en-000007023	The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 67.0 percent, followed by the industrial sector at 27.5 percent.
en-000007024	Agribusiness contributes to Brazil's trade balance, in spite of trade barriers and subsidizing policies adopted by the developed countries.
en-000007025	However, some of this is at the expense of the environment, including the Amazon.
en-000007026	With regards to family agriculture, over 800 thousand rural inhabitants are assisted by credit, research and extension programs.
en-000007027	A special line of credit is available for women and young farmers.
en-000007028	The idea is that access to land represents just the first step towards the implementation of a quality land reform program.
en-000007029	At the forefront of grain crops, which produce over 110 million tonnes/year, is the soybean, yielding 50 million tonnes.
en-000007030	Brazil has the largest cattle herd in the world, with 198 million heads, responsible for exports surpassing the mark of US$1 billion/year.
en-000007031	Accounting for 28.5 percent of GDP, Brazil's industries range from automobiles, steel and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft, and consumer durables.
en-000007032	During the early 1990s, the banking sector accounted for as much as 16 percent of the GDP.
en-000007033	Also, the previously monopolistic reinsurance sector is being opened up to third party companies.
en-000007034	Large iron and manganese reserves are important sources of industrial raw materials and export earnings.
en-000007035	Deposits of nickel, tin, chromite, uranium, bauxite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten, zinc, gold, and other minerals are exploited.
en-000007036	High-quality coking-grade coal required in the steel industry is in short supply.
en-000007037	The Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported petroleum.
en-000007038	Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007.
en-000007039	Brazil is one of the world's leading producers of hydroelectric power, with a current capacity of about 260,000 megawatts.
en-000007040	Brazil's first commercial nuclear reactor, Angra I, located near Rio de Janeiro, has been in operation for more than 10 years.
en-000007041	Angra II was completed in 2002 and is in operation too.
en-000007042	The three reactors would have combined capacity of 9,000 megawatts when completed.
en-000007043	The government also plans to build 19 more nuclear plants by the year 2020.
en-000007044	In the 21st century, Brazil reached the status of 8th largest economy in the world.
en-000007045	Originally, the export list was basic raw and primary goods, such as sugar, rubber and gold.
en-000007046	Today, 84 percent of exports consists of manufactured and semi-manufactured products.
en-000007047	The period of great economic transformation and growth occurred between 1875 and 1975.
en-000007048	The Brazilian government also launched a program for economic development acceleration called Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento, aiming to spur growth.
en-000007049	Brazil's transparency ranking status in the international world is 75th according to Transparency International.
en-000007050	Thus, respected economists say that the country won't be deeply affected by the current world economic crisis.
en-000007051	The year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with $115 billion of transactions.
en-000007052	In comparison to the other 54 countries studied, Brazil was the third-highest in total number of entrepreneurs.
en-000007053	Ipea, a government agency, found that 37 million jobs in Brazil were associated with businesses with up to 10 employees.
en-000007054	There is a healthy number of entrepreneurs, thanks to the huge market and the government programs.
en-000007055	Brazil's credit rating was downgraded by Standard& Poor's to BBB in March 2014, just one notch above junk.
en-000007056	The Confederate States, officially the Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.
en-000007057	), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was a confederation of secessionist American states existing from 1861 to 1865.
en-000007058	The government of the United States (the Union) rejected the claims of secession and considered the Confederacy illegitimate.
en-000007059	No foreign government officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent country, although the U.K. and France granted it belligerent status.
en-000007060	While the war lacked a formal end, nearly all Confederate forces had surrendered or disbanded by the end of 1865.
en-000007061	Jefferson Davis later lamented that the Confederacy had "disappeared" in 1865.
en-000007062	With the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, the Union made abolition of slavery a war goal (in addition to reunion).
en-000007063	As Union forces moved southward, large numbers of plantation slaves were freed.
en-000007064	Many joined the Union lines, enrolling in service as soldiers, teamsters and laborers.
en-000007065	The most notable advance was Sherman's "March to the Sea" in late 1864.
en-000007066	Much of the Confederacy's infrastructure was destroyed, including telegraph, railroads and bridges.
en-000007067	Internal movement became increasingly difficult for Southerners, weakening the economy and limiting army mobility.
en-000007068	These losses created an insurmountable disadvantage in men, materiel, and finance.
en-000007069	After four years of campaigning, Richmond was captured by Union forces in April 1865.
en-000007070	Shortly afterward, Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant, effectively signalling the collapse of the Confederacy.
en-000007071	President Davis was captured on May 10, 1865, and jailed in preparation for a treason trial that was ultimately never held.
en-000007072	By 1877, the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in the former Confederate states.
en-000007073	The Solid South of the early 20th century was built on white Democratic control of politics.
en-000007074	The region did not achieve national levels of prosperity until long after World War II.
en-000007075	It was formed by delegations from seven Southern slave states that had proclaimed their secession from the Union.
en-000007076	After the fighting began in April, four additional slave states seceded and were admitted.
en-000007077	Later, two states (Missouri and Kentucky) and two territories were given seats in the Confederate Congress.
en-000007078	For the duration of its existence, the Confederacy underwent trial by war.
en-000007079	The "Southern Cause" transcended the ideology of states'rights, tariff policy, or internal improvements.
en-000007080	This "Cause" supported, or descended from, cultural and financial dependence on the South's slavery-based economy.
en-000007081	Acknowledging the centrality of slavery to the Confederacy is essential for understanding the Confederate."
en-000007082	All had residents who cast significant numbers of Unionist votes in either the legislature, conventions, popular referendums, or in all three.
en-000007083	However, voting to remain in the Union did not mean that individuals were northern sympathizers.
en-000007084	The "Black Republicans" (as the Southerners called them) and their allies soon dominated the U.S. House, Senate, and Presidency.
en-000007085	On the U.S. Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney (a presumed supporter of slavery) was 83 years old, and ailing.
en-000007086	To the Secessionists the Republican intent was clear: to contain slavery within its present bounds, and, eventually, to eliminate it entirely.
en-000007087	Republicans captured over 60 percent of the Northern vote, while winning three-fourths of its Congressional delegations.
en-000007088	"The New Orleans Delta " said of the Republicans,"It is in fact, essentially, a revolutionary party" to overthrow slavery.
en-000007089	By 1860, sectional disagreements between North and South relate primarily to the maintenance or expansion of slavery in the United States.
en-000007090	Secondary differences related to issues of free speech, runaway slaves, expansion into Cuba, and states'rights.
en-000007091	Historian Emory Thomas assessed the Confederacy's self–image by studying the correspondence sent by the Confederate government in 1861–62 to foreign governments.
en-000007092	Four of the seceding states, the Deep South states of South Carolina,
en-000007093	Georgia also claimed a general Federal policy of favoring Northern over Southern economic interests.
en-000007094	The Fire-Eaters, calling for immediate secession, were opposed by two factions.
en-000007095	"Cooperationists" in the Deep South would delay secession until several states went together, maybe in a Southern Convention.
en-000007096	Under the influence of men such as Texas Governor Sam Houston, delay would have had the effect of sustaining the Union.
en-000007097	"Unionists", especially in the Border South, often former Whigs, appealed to sentimental attachment to the United States.
en-000007098	Southern Unionists'favorite presidential candidate was John Bell of Tennessee, sometimes running under an "Opposition Party" banner.
en-000007099	Governor William Henry Gist of South Carolina corresponded secretly with other Deep South governors, and most southern governors exchanged clandestine commissioners.
en-000007100	Charleston's secessionist "1860 Association" published over 200,000 pamphlets to persuade the youth of the South.
en-000007101	Senator James Chesnut, Jr. resigned, as did Senator James Henry Hammond.
en-000007102	Elections for Secessionist conventions were heated to "an almost raving pitch, no one dared dissent", said Freehling.
en-000007103	Across the South mobs expelled Yankees and (in Texas) killed Germans suspected of loyalty to the United States.
en-000007104	The Confederate capital was moved from Montgomery to Richmond, Virginia, in May 1861.
en-000007105	On February 22, 1862, Davis was inaugurated as president with a term of six years.
en-000007106	These efforts included taking possession of U.S. courts, custom houses, post offices, and most notably, arsenals and forts.
en-000007107	The stated purpose was to re-occupy U.S. properties throughout the South, as the U.S. Congress had not authorized their abandonment.
en-000007108	The resistance at Fort Sumter signaled his change of policy from that of the Buchanan Administration.
en-000007109	The people of both North and South demanded war, and young men rushed to their colors in the hundreds of thousands.
en-000007110	Unionist talk of reunion failed and Davis began raising a 100,000 man army.
en-000007111	Moderates in the Confederate Constitutional Convention included a provision against importation of slaves from Africa to appeal to the Upper South.
en-000007112	Non-slave states might join, but the radicals secured a two-thirds hurdle for them.
en-000007113	Seven states declared their secession from the United States before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861.
en-000007114	Kentucky declared neutrality but after Confederate troops moved in, the state government asked for Union troops to drive them out.
en-000007115	The splinter Confederate state government relocated to accompany western Confederate armies and never controlled the state population.
en-000007116	In Missouri, a constitutional convention was approved and delegates elected by voters.
en-000007117	However, the governor maneuvered to take control of the St. Louis Arsenal and restrict Federal movements.
en-000007118	This led to confrontation and in June Federal forces drove him and the General Assembly from Jefferson City.
en-000007119	The executive committee of the constitutional convention called the members together in July.
en-000007120	The convention declared the state offices vacant, and appointed a Unionist interim state government.
en-000007121	It is still a matter of debate as to whether a quorum existed for this vote.
en-000007122	The Confederate state government was unable to control very much Missouri territory.
en-000007123	It had its capital first at Neosho, then at Cassville, before being driven out of the state.
en-000007124	For the remainder of the war, it operated as a government in exile at Marshall, Texas.
en-000007125	Neither Kentucky nor Missouri was declared in rebellion in Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.
en-000007126	Voting for the representatives was mostly done by Confederate soldiers from Kentucky and Missouri.
en-000007127	In Virginia the populous counties along the Ohio and Pennsylvania borders rejected the Confederacy.
en-000007128	Attempts to secede from the Confederacy by some counties in East Tennessee were checked by martial law.
en-000007129	Although slave-holding Delaware and Maryland did not secede, citizens from those states exhibited divided loyalties.
en-000007130	But overall, 24,000 men from Maryland joined the Confederate armed forces, compared to 63,000 who joined Union forces.
en-000007131	Delaware never produced a full regiment for the Confederacy, but neither did it emancipate slaves as did Missouri and West Virginia.
en-000007132	They won the Battle of Mesilla and established a territorial government with Mesilla serving as its capital.
en-000007133	The Confederacy proclaimed the Confederate Arizona Territory on February 14, 1862, north to the 34th parallel.
en-000007134	Marcus H. MacWillie served in both Confederate Congresses as Arizona's delegate.
en-000007135	On July 12, 1861, the Confederate government signed a treaty with both the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian nations.
en-000007136	Six states created the Confederate States of America there on February 8, 1861.
en-000007137	Two sessions of the Provisional Congress were held in Montgomery, adjourning May 21.
en-000007138	Richmond, Virginia was chosen for the interim capital at the Virginia State Capitol.
en-000007139	The move was used by Vice President Stephens and others to encourage other border states to follow Virginia into the Confederacy.
en-000007140	In the political moment it was a show of "defiance and strength".
en-000007141	The Davis Administration's policy was that, "It must be held at all hazards."
en-000007142	The Permanent Confederate Congress and President were elected in the states and army camps on November 6, 1861.
en-000007143	The First Congress met in four sessions in Richmond from February 18, 1862, to February 17, 1864.
en-000007144	The Second Congress met there in two sessions, from May 2, 1864, to March 18, 1865.
en-000007145	As war dragged on, Richmond became crowded with training and transfers, logistics and hospitals.
en-000007146	A movement in Congress led by Henry S. Foote of Tennessee argued for moving the capital from Richmond.
en-000007147	At the approach of Federal armies in early summer 1862, the government's archives were readied for removal.
en-000007148	Shortly before the end of the war, the Confederate government evacuated Richmond, planning to relocate farther south.
en-000007149	Little came of these plans before Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865.
en-000007150	Davis and most of his cabinet fled to Danville, Virginia, which served as their headquarters for about one week.
en-000007151	Unionism was widespread in the Confederacy, especially in the mountain regions of Appalachia and the Ozarks.
en-000007152	Unionists, led by Parson Brownlow and Senator Andrew Johnson, took control of eastern Tennessee in 1863.
en-000007153	Union forces captured parts of coastal North Carolina, and at first were welcomed by local unionists.
en-000007154	That changed as the occupiers became perceived as oppressive, callous, radical and favorable to the Freedmen.
en-000007155	In Texas local officials harassed unionists and engaged in large-scale massacres against unionists and Germans.
en-000007156	Draft resistance was widespread especially among Texans of German or Mexican descent; many of the latter went to Mexico.
en-000007157	Potential draftees went into hiding, Confederate officials hunted them down, and many were shot.
en-000007158	The United States government regarded the southern states in rebellion and so refused any formal recognition of their status.
en-000007159	It called for troops to recapture forts and suppress what Lincoln later called an "insurrection and rebellion".
en-000007160	The Confederate government sent repeated delegations to Europe but historians give them low marks for their poor diplomacy.
en-000007161	James M. Mason went to London and John Slidell traveled to Paris.
en-000007162	They were unofficially interviewed, but neither secured official recognition for the Confederacy.
en-000007163	The Union victory at the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg) and abolitionist opposition in Britain put an end to these plans.
en-000007164	War would have meant higher taxes, another invasion of Canada, and full-scale worldwide attacks on the British merchant fleet.
en-000007165	John Slidell, emissary to France, did succeed in negotiating a loan of $15,000,000 from Erlanger and other French capitalists.
en-000007166	The money was used to buy ironclad warships, as well as military supplies that came in by blockade runners.
en-000007167	The British government did allow blockade runners to be built in Britain and operated by British seamen.
en-000007168	However, those nations did recognize the Union and Confederate sides as belligerents.
en-000007169	Both Confederate and Union agents were allowed to work openly in British territories.
en-000007170	Some state governments in northern Mexico negotiated local agreements to cover trade on the Texas border.
en-000007171	Though trade and investment agreements are being negotiated, they are increasingly regional in scope.
en-000007172	The Confederacy appointed Ambrose Dudley Mann as special agent to the Holy See on September 24, 1863.
en-000007173	But the Holy See never released a formal statement supporting or recognizing the Confederacy.
en-000007174	French Emperor Napoleon III assured Confederate diplomat John Slidell that he would make "direct proposition" to Britain for joint recognition.
en-000007175	The Emperor made the same assurance to Members of Parliament John A. Roebuck and John A. Lindsay.
en-000007176	Roebuck in turn publicly prepared a bill to submit to Parliament June 30 supporting joint Anglo-French recognition of the Confederacy.
en-000007177	"Southerners had a right to be optimistic, or at least hopeful, that their revolution would prevail, or at least endure".
en-000007178	The result was a defeat at Gettysburg and Lee barely escaped to Virginia, withdrawing into an interior defensive position.
en-000007179	Following the dual reverses at Vicksburg and Gettysburg, the Confederates "suffered a severe loss of confidence in themselves".
en-000007180	Europe, however, could see that the Confederacy was on the verge of total defeat.
en-000007181	The great majority of young white men voluntarily joined Confederate national or state military units.
en-000007182	Soldiers from slaveowning families were slightly overrepresented in the Army of Northern Virginia
en-000007183	Defensive strategy sought dispersal to meet demands of locally minded governors.
en-000007184	The controlling philosophy evolved into a combination "dispersal with a defensive concentration around Richmond".
en-000007185	But the troops there remained in place during the Gettysburg Campaign.
en-000007186	The eleven states of the Confederacy were outnumbered by the North about four to one in white men of military age.
en-000007187	It was overmatched far more in military equipment, industrial facilities, railroads for transport, and wagons supplying the front.
en-000007188	Confederate military policy innovated to slow the invaders, but at heavy cost to the Southern infrastructure.
en-000007189	On April 17, President Davis called on privateer raiders, the "militia of the sea", to make war on U.S. seaborne commerce.
en-000007190	He lacked reserve troops to exploit an advantage on the battlefield as Napoleon had done.
en-000007191	The military armed forces of the Confederacy comprised three branches: Army, Navy and Marine Corps.
en-000007192	The Confederate officer corps consisted of men from both slave-owning and non-slave-owning families.
en-000007193	The Confederacy appointed junior and field grade officers by election from the enlisted ranks.
en-000007194	A naval academy was established at Drewry's Bluff, Virginia in 1863, but no midshipmen graduated before the Confederacy's end.
en-000007195	The soldiers of the Confederate armed forces consisted mainly of white males aged between 16 and 28.
en-000007196	The median year of birth was 1838, so half the soldiers were 23 or older by 1861.
en-000007197	In early 1862, the Confederate Army was allowed to disintegrate for two months following expiration of short-term enlistments.
en-000007198	(The U.S. Congress would follow a year later on March 3, 1863, with the Enrollment Act.)
en-000007199	Rather than a universal draft, the initial program was a selective service with physical, religious, professional and industrial exemptions.
en-000007200	Initially substitutes were permitted, but by December 1863 these were disallowed.
en-000007201	Although challenged in the state courts, the Confederate State Supreme Courts routinely rejected legal challenges to conscription.
en-000007202	Depleted by casualties and desertions, the military suffered chronic manpower shortages.
en-000007203	Contrary to Lee's and Davis's recommendations, the Congress refused "to guarantee the freedom of black volunteers".
en-000007204	No more than two hundred black combat troops were ever raised.
en-000007205	The immediate onset of war meant that it was fought by the "Provisional" or "Volunteer Army".
en-000007206	It was important to raise troops; it was just as important to provide capable officers to command them.
en-000007207	Efficiency in the lower officers was "greater than could have been reasonably expected".
en-000007208	Otherwise, the officer corps was governor-appointed or elected by unit enlisted.
en-000007209	Promotion to fill vacancies was made internally regardless of merit, even if better officers were immediately available.
en-000007210	Congress allowed for Davis to require numbers of recruits from each governor to supply the volunteer shortfall.
en-000007211	The veteran Confederate army of early 1862 was mostly twelve-month volunteers with terms about to expire.
en-000007212	Officers pleaded with the ranks to re-enlist, but a majority did not.
en-000007213	Those remaining elected majors and colonels whose performance led to officer review boards in October.
en-000007214	The boards caused a "rapid and widespread" thinning out of 1700 incompetent officers.
en-000007215	In early 1862, the popular press suggested the Confederacy required a million men under arms.
en-000007216	But veteran soldiers were not re-enlisting, and earlier secessionist volunteers did not reappear to serve in war.
en-000007217	The Confederacy passed the first American law of national conscription on April 16, 1862.
en-000007218	They would serve only in units and under officers of their state.
en-000007219	Those under 18 and over 35 could substitute for conscripts, in September those from 35 to 45 became conscripts.
en-000007220	Confederate conscription was not universal; it was actually a selective service.
en-000007221	The First Conscription Act of April 1862 exempted occupations related to transportation, communication, industry, ministers, teaching and physical fitness.
en-000007222	The Second Conscription Act of October 1862 expanded exemptions in industry, agriculture and conscientious objection.
en-000007223	Exemption fraud proliferated in medical examinations, army furloughs, churches, schools, apothecaries and newspapers.
en-000007224	The number of officials under state exemptions appointed by state Governor patronage expanded significantly.
en-000007225	The Conscription Act of February 1864 "radically changed the whole system" of selection.
en-000007226	Many men in otherwise "bombproof" positions were enlisted in one way or another, nearly 160,000 additional volunteers and conscripts in uniform.
en-000007227	To administer the draft, a Bureau of Conscription was set up to use state officers, as state Governors would allow.
en-000007228	Armies appointed alternative military "recruiters" to bring in the out-of-uniform 17–50-year-old conscripts and deserters.
en-000007229	"Our ranks are constantly diminishing by battle and disease, and few recruits are received; the consequences are inevitable."
en-000007230	These regiments were assigned to recruit conscripts ages 17–50, recover deserters, and repel enemy cavalry raids.
en-000007231	The service retained men who had lost but one arm or a leg in home guards.
en-000007232	The survival of the Confederacy depended on a strong base of civilians and soldiers devoted to victory.
en-000007233	The American Civil War broke out in April 1861 with a Confederate victory at the Battle of Fort Sumter in Charleston.
en-000007234	In May, Federal troops crossed into Confederate territory along the entire border from the Chesapeake Bay to New Mexico.
en-000007235	Following each battle, Federals maintained a military presence and occupied Washington DC, Fort Monroe VA and Springfield MO.
en-000007236	Both North and South began training up armies for major fighting the next year.
en-000007237	Meanwhile, the Union Navy seized control of much of the Confederate coastline from Virginia to South Carolina.
en-000007238	Federals there began a war-long policy of burning grain supplies up rivers into the interior wherever they could not occupy.
en-000007239	The victories of 1861 were followed by a series of defeats east and west in early 1862.
en-000007240	Following the repulse of Confederate counter-attack at the Battle of Shiloh, Tennessee, permanent Federal occupation expanded west, south and east.
en-000007241	It had to concede extensive agricultural resources that had supported the Union's sea-supplied logistics base.
en-000007242	Federal forces disrupted Missouri and Arkansas; they had broken through in western Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Louisiana.
en-000007243	During the Civil War fleets of armored warships were deployed for the first time in sustained blockades at sea.
en-000007244	Attempts were made by Commodore Josiah Tattnall's ironclads from Savannah in 1862 with the CSS "Atlanta".
en-000007245	Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory placed his hopes in a European-built ironclad fleet, but they were never realized.
en-000007246	They were converted into commerce-raiding cruisers, and manned by their British crews.
en-000007247	General McClellan landed his army on the Lower Peninsula of Virginia.
en-000007248	Both armies then turned to winter quarters to recruit and train for the coming spring.
en-000007249	Civil War scholar Allan Nevins argues that 1862 was the strategic high-water mark of the Confederacy.
en-000007250	July brought short-lived counters, Morgan's Raid into Ohio and the New York City draft riots.
en-000007251	Robert E. Lee's strike into Pennsylvania was repulsed at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania despite Pickett's famous charge and other acts of valor.
en-000007252	Southern newspapers assessed the campaign as "The Confederates did not gain a victory, neither did the enemy."
en-000007253	September and November left Confederates yielding Chattanooga, Tennessee, the gateway to the lower south.
en-000007254	For the remainder of the war fighting was restricted inside the South, resulting in a slow but continuous loss of territory.
en-000007255	In early 1864, the Confederacy still controlled 53% of its population, but it withdrew further to reestablish defensive positions.
en-000007256	Congress authorized a uniformed Volunteer Navy, many of whom were British.
en-000007257	Wilmington and Charleston had more shipping while "blockaded" than before the beginning of hostilities.
en-000007258	Commodore Tattnall unsuccessfully attempted to break the Union blockade on the Savannah River GA with an ironclad again in 1863.
en-000007259	The Federals closed Mobile Bay by sea-based amphibious assault in August, ending Gulf coast trade east of the Mississippi River.
en-000007260	In December, the Battle of Nashville ended Confederate operations in the western theater.
en-000007261	The National Library of Medicine holds a collection of papers from Confederate hospitals and medical service during wartime.
en-000007262	Large numbers of families relocated to safer places, usually remote rural areas, bringing along household slaves if they had any.
en-000007263	Mary Massey argues these elite exiles introduced an element of defeatism into the southern outlook.
en-000007264	The first three months of 1865 saw the Federal Carolinas Campaign, devastating a wide swath of the remaining Confederate heartland.
en-000007265	The "breadbasket of the Confederacy" in the Great Valley of Virginia was occupied by Philip Sheridan.
en-000007266	The Union Blockade captured Fort Fisher NC, and Sherman finally took Charleston SC by land attack.
en-000007267	Its administration survived in only three pockets of territory holding one-third its population.
en-000007268	The Confederacy's last remaining blockade-running port, Wilmington, North Carolina, was lost.
en-000007269	When the Union broke through Lee's lines at Petersburg, Richmond fell immediately.
en-000007270	Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, 1865.
en-000007271	The CSS "Stonewall" sailed from Europe to break the Union blockade in March; on making Havana, Cuba it surrendered.
en-000007272	Historian Gary Gallagher concluded that the Confederacy capitulated in the spring of 1865 because northern armies crushed "organized southern military resistance".
en-000007273	The Confederacy's population, soldier and civilian, had suffered material hardship and social disruption.
en-000007274	They had expended and extracted a profusion of blood and treasure until collapse; "the end had come".
en-000007275	When the war ended over 14,000 Confederates petitioned President Johnson for a pardon; he was generous in giving them out.
en-000007276	He issued a general amnesty to all Confederate participants in the "late Civil War" in 1868.
en-000007277	Congress passed additional Amnesty Acts in May 1866 with restrictions on office holding, and again in May 1872 lifting those restrictions.
en-000007278	There was a great deal of discussion in 1865 about bringing treason trials, especially against Jefferson Davis.
en-000007279	There was no consensus in President Johnson's cabinet and there were no treason trials against anyone.
en-000007280	In the case of Davis there was a strong possibility of acquittal which would have been humiliating for the government.
en-000007281	Davis was indicted for treason but never tried; he was released from prison on bail in May 1867.
en-000007282	In this case, the court held that the Constitution did not permit a state to unilaterally secede from the United States.
en-000007283	This case settled the law that applied to all questions regarding state legislation during the war.
en-000007284	Historian Frank Lawrence Owsley argued that the Confederacy "died of states'rights."
en-000007285	Georgia's governor Joseph Brown warned of a secret conspiracy by Jefferson Davis to destroy states'rights and individual liberty.
en-000007286	The first conscription act in North America authorizing Davis to draft soldiers was said to be the "essence of military despotism".
en-000007287	Vice President Alexander Stephens feared losing the very form of republican government.
en-000007288	Governor Zebulon Vance of North Carolina showed intense opposition to conscription, limiting recruitment success.
en-000007289	Vance's faith in states'rights drove him into repeated, stubborn opposition to the Davis administration.
en-000007290	Despite political differences within the Confederacy, no national political parties were formed because they were seen as illegitimate.
en-000007291	Without a two-party system building alternative sets of national leaders, electoral protests tended to be narrowly state-based, "negative, carping and petty".
en-000007292	The 1863 mid-term elections became mere expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction.
en-000007293	The enemies of President Davis proposed that the Confederacy "died of Davis."
en-000007294	Coulter summarizes, "The American Revolution had its Washington; the Southern Revolution had its Davis ... one succeeded and the other failed."
en-000007295	His ill health and temporary bouts of blindness disabled him for days at a time.
en-000007296	But his "tenacity, determination, and will power" stirred up lasting opposition of enemies Davis could not shake.
en-000007297	The prewar claim that white solidarity was necessary to provide a unified Southern voice in Washington no longer held.
en-000007298	He spent too much time on military affairs versus his civil responsibilities.
en-000007299	Robert E. Lee's assessment of Davis as President was, "I knew of none that could have done as well."
en-000007300	The Southern leaders met in Montgomery, Alabama, to write their constitution.
en-000007301	It maintained the existing ban on international slave-trading while protecting the existing internal trade of slaves among slaveholding states.
en-000007302	State legislatures had the power to impeach officials of the Confederate government in some cases.
en-000007303	During the debates on drafting the Confederate Constitution, one proposal would have allowed states to secede from the Confederacy.
en-000007304	The proposal was tabled with only the South Carolina delegates voting in favor of considering the motion.
en-000007305	The Montgomery Convention to establish the Confederacy and its executive met February 4, 1861.
en-000007306	Offices were "provisional", limited to a term not to exceed one year.
en-000007307	One name was placed in nomination for president, one for vice president.
en-000007308	Three candidates for provisional Vice President were under consideration the night before the February 9 election.
en-000007309	Davis and Stephens were elected President and Vice President, unopposed on November 6, 1861.
en-000007310	Historian E. M. Coulter observed, "No president of the U.S. ever had a more difficult task."
en-000007311	The creation of the Confederacy was accomplished by men who saw themselves as fundamentally conservative.
en-000007312	In Davis'inauguration speech, he explained the Confederacy was not a French-like revolution, but a transfer of rule.
en-000007313	The Montgomery Convention had assumed all the laws of the United States until superseded by the Confederate Congress.
en-000007314	In addition, appropriations not specifically requested by the executive branch required passage by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress.
en-000007315	The Confederacy was begun by the Provisional Congress in Convention at Montgomery, Alabama on February 28, 1861.
en-000007316	The Permanent Confederate Congress was elected and began its first session February 18, 1862.
en-000007317	The Permanent Congress for the Confederacy followed the United States forms with a bicameral legislature.
en-000007318	The House numbered 106 representatives apportioned by free and slave populations within each state.
en-000007319	The political influences of the civilian, soldier vote and appointed representatives reflected divisions of political geography of a diverse South.
en-000007320	Without political parties, key candidate identification related to adopting secession before or after Lincoln's call for volunteers to retake Federal property.
en-000007321	Previous party affiliation played a part in voter selection, predominantly secessionist Democrat or unionist Whig.
en-000007322	For the first year, the unicameral Provisional Confederate Congress functioned as the Confederacy's legislative branch.
en-000007323	In many cases, the same US Federal District Judges were appointed as Confederate States District Judges.
en-000007324	Eventually, because there was no Confederate Supreme Court, sharp attorneys like South Carolina's Edward McCrady began filing appeals.
en-000007325	Where Federal troops gained control over parts of the Confederacy and re-established civilian government, US district courts sometimes resumed jurisdiction.
en-000007326	When the war began, the US Post Office still delivered mail from the secessionist states for a brief period of time.
en-000007327	After this time, private express companies still managed to carry some of the mail across enemy lines.
en-000007328	With the chaos of the war, a working postal system was more important than ever for the Confederacy.
en-000007329	Mail delivery was also important for the Confederacy for a myriad of business and military reasons.
en-000007330	The Confederacy actively used the army to arrest people suspected of loyalty to the United States.
en-000007331	Historian Mark Neely found 4,108 names of men arrested and estimated a much larger total.
en-000007332	Across the South, widespread rumors alarmed the whites by predicting the slaves were planning some sort of insurrection.
en-000007333	The slaves did become increasingly independent, and resistant to punishment, but historians agree there were no insurrections.
en-000007334	Many slaves became spies for the North, and large numbers ran away to federal lines.
en-000007335	Many freed slaves served as volunteers in the federal army as teamsters, cooks, laundresses and laborers, and eventually as soldiers.
en-000007336	By "Juneteenth" (June 19, 1865, in Texas), the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and had liberated all its slaves.
en-000007337	The plantations of the South, with white ownership and an enslaved labor force, produced substantial wealth from cash crops.
en-000007338	These raw materials were exported to factories in Europe and the Northeast.
en-000007339	Planters reinvested their profits in more slaves and fresh land, for cotton and tobacco depleted the soil.
en-000007340	There was little manufacturing or mining; shipping was controlled by outsiders.
en-000007341	The plantations that employed over three million black slaves were the principal source of wealth.
en-000007342	Most were concentrated in "black belt" plantation areas (because few white families in the poor regions owned slaves.)
en-000007343	Historian William Barney reports, "no major slave revolts erupted during the Civil War."
en-000007344	Slave labor was applied in industry in a limited way in the Upper South and in a few port cities.
en-000007345	One reason for the regional lag in industrial development was top-heavy income distribution.
en-000007346	The Southern economy was "pre-capitalist" in that slaves were put to work in the largest revenue-producing enterprises, not free labor market.
en-000007347	A third count of southern pre-capitalist economy relates to the cultural setting.
en-000007348	It had access to the tools of capitalism, but it did not adopt its culture.
en-000007349	Many planters kept growing cotton, which piled up everywhere, but most turned to food production.
en-000007350	All across the region, the lack of repair and maintenance wasted away the physical assets.
en-000007351	The main industrial areas were border cities such as Baltimore, Wheeling, Louisville and St. Louis, that were never under Confederate control.
en-000007352	The government did set up munitions factories in the Deep South.
en-000007353	Combined with captured munitions and those coming via blockade runners, the armies were kept minimally supplied with weapons.
en-000007354	The soldiers suffered from reduced rations, lack of medicines, and the growing shortages of uniforms, shoes and boots.
en-000007355	Shortages were much worse for civilians, and the prices of necessities steadily rose.
en-000007356	The Confederate government in its entire history collected only $3.5 million in tariff revenue.
en-000007357	The lack of adequate financial resources led the Confederacy to finance the war through printing money, which led to high inflation.
en-000007358	They tied plantation areas to the nearest river or seaport and so made supply more dependable, lowered costs and increased profits.
en-000007359	In the event of invasion, the vast geography of the Confederacy made logistics difficult for the Union.
en-000007360	Wherever Union armies invaded, they assigned many of their soldiers to garrison captured areas and to protect rail lines.
en-000007361	Locomotives and freight cars had fixed axles and could not roll on tracks of different gauges (widths).
en-000007362	In addition, most rail lines led from coastal or river ports to inland cities, with few lateral railroads.
en-000007363	The Confederacy had no plan to expand, protect or encourage its railroads.
en-000007364	Refusal to export the cotton crop in 1861 left railroads bereft of their main source of income.
en-000007365	Many lines had to lay off employees; many critical skilled technicians and engineers were permanently lost to military service.
en-000007366	For the early years of the war, the Confederate government had a hands-off approach to the railroads.
en-000007367	Only in mid-1863 did the Confederate government initiate an national policy, and it was confined solely to aiding the war effort.
en-000007368	Confederate reoccupation of territory by successful armies could not be resupplied directly by rail as they advanced.
en-000007369	In the last year before the end of the war, the Confederate railroad system stood permanently on the verge of collapse.
en-000007370	There was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars.
en-000007371	Union forces paid in real money and found ready sellers in the South.
en-000007372	The supply was undermined by an unprecedented epidemic of glanders, a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians.
en-000007373	The Confederate armies and farmers experienced a growing shortage of horses and mules, which hurt the economy and the war effort.
en-000007374	The South lost half of its 2.5 million horses and mules; many farmers ended the war with none left.
en-000007375	Army horses were used up by hard work, malnourishment, disease and battle wounds; their life expectancy was about seven months.
en-000007376	Much of it was signed by the Treasurer Edward C. Elmore.
en-000007377	Inflation became rampant as the paper money depreciated and eventually became worthless.
en-000007378	The state governments and some localities printed their own paper money, adding to the runaway inflation.
en-000007379	Many bills still exist, although in recent years counterfeit copies have proliferated.
en-000007380	The Confederate government initially wanted to finance its war mostly through tariffs on imports, export taxes, and voluntary donations of gold.
en-000007381	The Confederate States politicians were worried about angering the general population with hard taxes.
en-000007382	A tax increase might disillusion many Southerners, so the Confederacy resorted to printing more money.
en-000007383	As a result, inflation increased and remained a problem for the southern states throughout the rest of the war.
en-000007384	By April 1863, for example, the cost of flour in Richmond had risen to $100 a barrel and housewives were rioting.
en-000007385	During 1861, the first two produced small amounts of gold coinage, the latter half dollars.
en-000007386	Since the mints used the current dies on hand, these issues remain indistinguishable from those minted by the Union.
en-000007387	However, in New Orleans the Confederacy did use its own reverse design to strike four half dollars.
en-000007388	US coinage was hoarded and did not have any general circulation.
en-000007389	By summer 1861, the Union naval blockade virtually shut down the export of cotton and the import of manufactured goods.
en-000007390	State governments pleaded with planters to grow less cotton and more food.
en-000007391	Most refused, some believing that the Yankees would not or could not fight.
en-000007392	When cotton prices soared in Europe, expectations were that Europe would soon intervene to break the blockade and make them rich.
en-000007393	Neither proved true and the myth of omnipotent "King Cotton" died hard.
en-000007394	The Georgia legislature imposed cotton quotas, making it a crime to grow an excess.
en-000007395	The women expressed their anger at ineffective state relief efforts, speculators, merchants and planters.
en-000007396	As wives and widows of soldiers they were hurt by the inadequate welfare system.
en-000007397	By the end of the war deterioration of the Southern infrastructure was widespread.
en-000007398	Historians have recently estimated how much of the devastation was caused by military action.
en-000007399	Military operations were conducted in 56% of 645 counties in nine Confederate states (excluding Texas and Florida).
en-000007400	These counties contained 63% of the 1860 white population and 64% of the slaves.
en-000007401	Historians have not estimated what their actual population was when Union forces arrived.
en-000007402	Many old tools had broken through heavy use; new tools were rarely available; even repairs were difficult.
en-000007403	Most farms were intact but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair.
en-000007404	Paskoff shows the loss of farm infrastructure was about the same whether or not fighting took place nearby.
en-000007405	During four years of warfare, disruption, and blockades, the South used up about half its capital stock.
en-000007406	The rebuilding would take years and was hindered by the low price of cotton after the war.
en-000007407	One historian has summarized the collapse of the transportation infrastructure needed for economic recovery:
en-000007408	About 250,000 men never came home, some 30 percent of all white men aged 18 to 40, in 1860.
en-000007409	In the Old South, being an "old maid" was something of an embarrassment to the woman and her family.
en-000007410	To rectify the situation, a separate "Battle Flag" was designed for use by troops in the field.
en-000007411	Also known as the "Southern Cross", many variations sprang from the original square configuration.
en-000007412	Thus, in 1865, a modified version of the Stainless Banner was adopted.
en-000007413	This flag, however, was never adopted as a Confederate national flag.
en-000007414	The "Confederate Flag" has a color scheme similar to the official Battle Flag, but is rectangular, not square.
en-000007415	(Its design and shape matches the Naval Jack, but the blue bars are darker.)
en-000007416	The lower reaches of the Mississippi River bisected the country, with the western half often referred to as the Trans-Mississippi.
en-000007417	The subtropical climate made winters mild but allowed infectious diseases to flourish.
en-000007418	The United States Census of 1860 gives a picture of the overall 1860 population of the areas that joined the Confederacy.
en-000007419	The area claimed by the Confederate States of America consisted overwhelmingly of rural land.
en-000007420	Few urban areas had populations of more than 1,000 – the typical county seat had a population of fewer than 500 people.
en-000007421	The population of Richmond swelled after it became the Confederate capital, reaching an estimated 128,000 in 1864.
en-000007422	The cities of the Confederacy included most prominently in order of size of population:
en-000007423	Military leaders of the Confederacy (with their state or country of birth and highest rank) included:
en-000007424	Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life.
en-000007425	Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan.
en-000007426	Ongoing debates include biological essentialism vs. neuroplasticity and stages of development vs. dynamic systems of development.
en-000007427	John B. Watson and Jean-Jacques Rousseau are typically cited as providing the foundations for modern developmental psychology.
en-000007428	In the mid-18th century Jean Jacques Rousseau described three stages of development: "infants" (infancy), "puer" (childhood) and "adolescence" in "".
en-000007429	Rousseau's ideas were taken up strongly by educators at the time.
en-000007430	Sigmund Freud, whose concepts were developmental, had a significant impact on public perceptions.
en-000007431	Attachment theory, originally developed by John Bowlby, focuses on the importance of open, intimate, emotionally meaningful relationships.
en-000007432	Attachment is described as a biological system or powerful survival impulse that evolved to ensure the survival of the infant.
en-000007433	Later Mary Ainsworth developed the Strange Situation protocol and the concept of the secure base.
en-000007434	There are four types of attachment styles: secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-resistant, and disorganized.
en-000007435	Secure attachment is a healthy attachment between the infant and the caregiver.
en-000007436	Anxious-avoidant is an insecure attachment between an infant and a caregiver.
en-000007437	Disorganized is an attachment style without a consistent pattern of responses upon return of the parent.
en-000007438	A child can be hindered in its natural tendency to form attachments.
en-000007439	The possible short-term effects of this deprivation are anger, despair, detachment, and temporary delay in intellectual development.
en-000007440	The short-term effect of Katrina was to drive stories about Iraq off of television screens and newspaper front pages.
en-000007441	Long-term effects include increased aggression, clinging behavior, detachment, psychosomatic disorders, and an increased risk of depression as an adult.
en-000007442	Attachment is established in early childhood and attachment continues in adulthood.
en-000007443	An example of anxious attachment during adulthood is when the adult chooses a partner with anxious-avoidant attachment.
en-000007444	Constructivism is a paradigm in psychology that characterizes learning as a process of actively constructing knowledge.
en-000007445	Piaget proposed that learning should be whole by helping students understand that meaning is constructed.
en-000007446	Each system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape development.
en-000007447	Microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school.
en-000007448	Exosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role.
en-000007449	Macrosystem refers to the cultural values, customs and laws of society.
en-000007450	The microsystem is the immediate environment surrounding and influencing the individual (example: school or the home setting).
en-000007451	Sigmund Freud believed that we all had a conscious, preconscious, and unconscious level.
en-000007452	The preconscious involves information that, though not currently in our thoughts, can be brought into consciousness.
en-000007453	To explain this he developed three personality structures: the id, ego, and superego.
en-000007454	The id, the most primitive of the three, functions according to the pleasure principle: seek pleasure and avoid pain.
en-000007455	The first is the "oral stage", which occurs from birth to 12 months of age.
en-000007456	During the oral stage "the libido is centered in a baby's mouth."
en-000007457	The second is the "anal stage", from one to three years of age.
en-000007458	During the phallic stage, the child is aware of their sexual organs.
en-000007459	The fourth is the "latency stage", which occurs from age five until puberty.
en-000007460	Stage five is the "genital stage", which takes place from puberty until adulthood.
en-000007461	He suggested three levels of moral reasoning; preconventional moral reasoning, conventional moral reasoning, and postconventional moral reasoning.
en-000007462	Kohlberg used the Heinz Dilemma to apply to his stages of moral development.
en-000007463	Preconventional morality, conventional morality, and postconventional morality applies to Heinz's situation.
en-000007464	The first stage is called "Trust vs. Mistrust" takes place in infancy.
en-000007465	The second stage is "Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt" with the best virtue being will.
en-000007466	The basic virtue that would be gained is purpose and takes place in the play age.
en-000007467	This is the stage where the child will be curious and have many interactions with other kids.
en-000007468	If too much guilt is present, the child may have a slower and harder time interacting with other.
en-000007469	The basic virtue for this stage is competency which happens at the school age.
en-000007470	The basic virtue gained is fidelity which takes place in adolescence.
en-000007471	This is where the child will start to find who he/she is as a person in society.
en-000007472	Isolation", which happens in young adults and the virtue gained is love.
en-000007473	This is where the person will start to share his/her life with someone else intimately and emotionally.
en-000007474	This happens in adulthood and the virtue gained would be care.
en-000007475	We become stable and start to give back by raising a family and becoming involved in the community.
en-000007476	When one grows old and they contemplate and look back and seeing the success or failure of their life.
en-000007477	This is also the stage where one can also have closure and accept death without fearing anything.
en-000007478	Jean Piaget, a Swiss theorist, posited that children learn by actively constructing knowledge through hands-on experience.
en-000007479	Piaget believed that intellectual development takes place through a series of stages, which he described in his theory on cognitive development.
en-000007480	Each stage consists of steps the child must master before moving to the next step.
en-000007481	He proposed four stages: "sensorimotor", "pre-operational", "concrete operational", and "formal operational".
en-000007482	Stage is the order hierarchical complexity of the tasks the participant's successfully addresses.
en-000007483	He expanded Piaget's original eight stage (counting the half stages) to fifteen stages.
en-000007484	The order of hierarchical complexity of tasks predicts how difficult the performance is with a R ranging from 0.9 to 0.98.
en-000007485	Axioms are rules that are followed to determine how the MHC orders actions to form a hierarchy.
en-000007486	This is often referred to as "nature and nurture" or nativism versus empiricism.
en-000007487	An empiricist perspective would argue that those processes are acquired in interaction with the environment.
en-000007488	One of the ways this relationship has been explored in recent years is through the emerging field of evolutionary developmental psychology.
en-000007489	One area where this innateness debate has been prominently portrayed is in research on language acquisition.
en-000007490	But Skinner's conception of "Verbal Behavior" has not died, perhaps in part because it has generated successful practical applications.
en-000007491	Psychologists have attempted to better understand these factors by using models.
en-000007492	Developmental models are sometimes computational, but they do not need to be.
en-000007493	A model must simply account for the means by which a process takes place.
en-000007494	Computational accounts of development often use either symbolic, connectionist (neural network), or dynamical systems models to explain the mechanisms of development.
en-000007495	Major topics in cognitive development are the study of language acquisition and the development of perceptual and motor skills.
en-000007496	Piaget was one of the influential early psychologists to study the development of cognitive abilities.
en-000007497	Thus, development should be analyzed, instead of treated as a product to obtain.
en-000007498	K. Warner Schaie has expanded the study of cognitive development into adulthood.
en-000007499	Rather than being stable from adolescence, Schaie sees adults as progressing in the application of their cognitive abilities.
en-000007500	Developmental psychologists who are interested in social development examine how individuals develop social and emotional competencies.
en-000007501	For example, they study how children form friendships, how they understand and deal with emotions, and how identity develops.
en-000007502	Research in this area may involve study of the relationship between cognition or cognitive development and social behavior.
en-000007503	Emotional regulation or ER refers to an individual's ability to modulate emotional responses across a variety of contexts.
en-000007504	In young children, this modulation is in part controlled externally, by parents and other authority figures.
en-000007505	As children develop, they take on more and more responsibility for their internal state.
en-000007506	A child's social and emotional development can be disrupted by motor coordination problems as evidenced by the environmental stress hypothesis.
en-000007507	Motor coordination problems affect fine and gross motor movement as well as perceptual-motor skills.
en-000007508	Social and emotional development focuses on 5 keys areas: Self-Awareness, Self Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Skills and Responsible Decision Making.
en-000007509	Physical development concerns the physical maturation of an individual's body until it reaches the adult stature.
en-000007510	Although physical growth is a highly regular process, all children differ tremendously in the timing of their growth spurts.
en-000007511	Researchers interested in memory development look at the way our memory develops from childhood and onward.
en-000007512	According to Fuzzy-trace theory, we have two separate memory processes: verbatim and gist.
en-000007513	These two traces begin to develop at different times as well as at a different pace.
en-000007514	Furthermore, our reliance on gist memory traces increases as we age.
en-000007515	Developmental psychology employs many of the research methods used in other areas of psychology.
en-000007516	Developmental psychologists have a number of methods to study changes in individuals over time.
en-000007517	Every developmental investigation can be characterized in terms of whether its underlying strategy involves the "experimental", "correlational", or "case study" approach.
en-000007518	The advantage of using this research method is that it permits determination of cause-and-effect relationships among variables.
en-000007519	On the other hand, the limitation is that data obtained in an artificial environment may lack generalizability.
en-000007520	The correlational method explores the relationship between two or more events by gathering information about these variables without researcher intervention.
en-000007521	Research designs are logical frameworks used to make key comparisons within research studies such as:
en-000007522	Researchers may also observe ways that development varies between individuals, and hypothesize about the causes of variation in their data.
en-000007523	Longitudinal studies often require large amounts of time and funding, making them unfeasible in some situations.
en-000007524	In a cross-sectional study, a researcher observes differences between individuals of different ages at the same time.
en-000007525	Prenatal development is of interest to psychologists investigating the context of early psychological development.
en-000007526	The whole prenatal development involves three main stages: germinal stage, embryonic stage and fetal stage.
en-000007527	Sense of touch develops in the embryonic stage (5 to 8 weeks).
en-000007528	Some primitive reflexes too arise before birth and are still present in newborns.
en-000007529	One hypothesis is that these reflexes are vestigial and have limited use in early human life.
en-000007530	Piaget's theory of cognitive development suggested that some early reflexes are building blocks for infant sensorimotor development.
en-000007531	For example, the tonic neck reflex may help development by bringing objects into the infant's field of view.
en-000007532	Other reflexes, such as the walking reflex appear to be replaced by more sophisticated voluntary control later in infancy.
en-000007533	Primitive reflexes reappear in adults under certain conditions, such as neurological conditions like dementia or traumatic lesions.
en-000007534	Prenatal development and birth complications may also be connected to neurodevelopmental disorders, for example in schizophrenia.
en-000007535	With the advent of cognitive neuroscience, embryology and the neuroscience of prenatal development is of increasing interest to developmental psychology research.
en-000007536	A leading example of this would be that, in America alone, approximately 100,000-375,000'cocaine babies'are born on an annual basis.
en-000007537	This is a result of an expectant mother abusing the drug while pregnant.
en-000007538	'Cocaine babies'are proven to have quite severe and lasting difficulties which persist throughout infancy and right throughout childhood.
en-000007539	The drug also encourages behavioural problems in the affected children, as well as defects of various vital organs.
en-000007540	From birth until the first year, the child is referred to as an infant.
en-000007541	The majority of a newborn infant's time is spent in sleep.
en-000007542	Infants can be seen to have six states, grouped into pairs:
en-000007543	Infant perception is what a newborn can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch.
en-000007544	Babies are born with the ability to discriminate virtually all sounds of all human languages.
en-000007545	Piaget's sensorimotor stage comprised six sub-stages (see sensorimotor stages for more detail).
en-000007546	In the early stages, development arises out of movements caused by primitive reflexes.
en-000007547	Discovery of new behaviors results from classical and operant conditioning, and the formation of habits.
en-000007548	From eight months the infant is able to uncover a hidden object but will persevere when the object is moved.
en-000007549	Instead infants continue to look for an object where it was first seen, committing the "A-not-B error."
en-000007550	Since then, many studies based on these methods suggest that young infants understand far more about the world than first thought.
en-000007551	The concept of critical periods is also well-established in neurophysiology, from the work of Hubel and Wiesel among others.
en-000007552	Infants shift between ages of one and two to a developmental stage known as toddlerhood.
en-000007553	During toddlerhood, babies begin learning how to walk, talk, and make decisions for themselves.
en-000007554	At this age, children take initiative to explore, experiment, and learn from making mistakes.
en-000007555	Caretakers who encourage toddlers to try new things and test their limits, help the child become autonomous, self-reliant, and confident.
en-000007556	The child's autonomic development is inhibited, leaving them less prepared to deal with the world in the future.
en-000007557	Socially, the period of toddler-hood is commonly called the "terrible twos".
en-000007558	A person at this stage testing their independence is another reason behind the stage's infamous label.
en-000007559	Erik Erikson divides childhood into four stages, each with its distinct social crisis:
en-000007560	In the earliest years, children are "completely dependent on the care of others."
en-000007561	Therefore, they develop a "social relationship" with their care givers and, later, with family members.
en-000007562	During their preschool years (3-5), they "enlarge their social horizons" to include people outside the family.
en-000007563	Preoperational and then operational thinking develops, which means actions are reversible, and egocentric thought diminishes.
en-000007564	The motor skills of preschoolers increase so they can do more things for themselves.
en-000007565	No longer completely dependent on the care of others, the world of this age group expands.
en-000007566	For Piaget, through play "a child reaches higher levels of cognitive development."
en-000007567	In their expanded world, children in the 3-5 age group attempt to find their own way.
en-000007568	If this is done in a socially acceptable way, the child develops initiative.
en-000007569	Children who develop "guilt" rather than "initiative" have failed Erikson’s psychosocial crisis for the 3-5 age group.
en-000007570	In all cultures, middle childhood is a time for developing "skills that will be needed in their society."
en-000007571	School offers an arena in which children can gain a view of themselves as "industrious (and worthy)."
en-000007572	They are "graded for their school work and often for their industry."
en-000007573	They can also develop industry outside of school in sports, games, and doing volunteer work.
en-000007574	Children who achieve "success in school or games might develop a feeling of competence."
en-000007575	The"peril during this period is that feelings of inadequacy and inferiority will develop.
en-000007576	Parents and teachers can "undermine" a child’s development by failing to recognize accomplishments or being overly critical of a child’s efforts.
en-000007577	Children who are "encouraged and praised" develop belief in their competence.
en-000007578	Lack of encouragement or ability to excel lead to "feelings of inadequacy and inferiority".
en-000007579	Entering elementary school, children in this age group begin to thinks about the future and their "place in the world."
en-000007580	Working with other students and wanting their friendship and acceptance become more important.
en-000007581	For children ages 9–11 "friendships and peer relationships" increase in strength, complexity, and importance.
en-000007582	They grow even less dependent on their families and they are challenged academically.
en-000007583	To meet this challenge, they increase their attention span and learn to see other points of view.
en-000007584	Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts and formal reasoning.
en-000007585	A return to egocentric thought often occurs early in the period.
en-000007586	Only 35% develop the capacity to reason formally during adolescence or adulthood.
en-000007587	Like toddlers, adolescents must explore, test limits, become autonomous, and commit to an identity, or sense of self.
en-000007588	Different roles, behaviors and ideologies must be tried out to select an identity.
en-000007589	Early adulthood, according to theorists such as Erik Erikson, is a stage where development is mainly focused on maintaining relationships.
en-000007590	Examples include creating bond of intimacy, sustaining friendships, and ultimately making a family.
en-000007591	Some theorists state that development of intimacy skills rely on the resolution of previous developmental stages.
en-000007592	A sense of identity gained in the previous stages is also necessary for intimacy to develop.
en-000007593	A related framework for studying this part of the life span is that of emerging adulthood.
en-000007594	Scholars of emerging adulthood, such as Jeffrey Arnett, are not necessarily interested in relationship development.
en-000007595	Middle adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 25 to 69.
en-000007596	During this period, middle-aged adults experience a conflict between generativity and stagnation.
en-000007597	Physically, the middle-aged experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, sensory keenness, and cardiac output.
en-000007598	Also, women experience menopause and a sharp drop in the hormone estrogen.
en-000007599	As men age, lowered testosterone levels can contribute to mood swings and a decline in sperm count.
en-000007600	Sexual responsiveness can also be affected, including delays in erection and longer periods of penile stimulation required to achieve ejaculation.
en-000007601	The World Health Organization finds "no general agreement on the age at which a person becomes old."
en-000007602	However, in developing countries inability to make "active contribution" to society, not chronological age, marks the beginning of old age.
en-000007603	According to Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, old age is the stage in which individuals assess the quality of their lives.
en-000007604	Physically, older people experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, stamina, hearing, distance perception, and the sense of smell.
en-000007605	They also are more susceptible to diseases such as cancer and pneumonia due to a weakened immune system.
en-000007606	Sexual expression depends in large part upon the emotional and physical health of the individual.
en-000007607	Many older adults continue to be sexually active and satisfied with their sexual activity.
en-000007608	Mental disintegration may also occur, leading to dementia or ailments such as Alzheimer's disease.
en-000007609	It is generally believed that crystallized intelligence increases up to old age, while fluid intelligence decreases with age.
en-000007610	Whether or not normal intelligence increases or decreases with age depends on the measure and study.
en-000007611	Longitudinal studies show that perceptual speed, inductive reasoning, and spatial orientation decline.
en-000007612	An article on adult cognitive development reports that cross-sectional studies show that "some abilities remained stable into early old age."
en-000007613	Parenting variables alone have typically accounted for 20 to 50 percent of the variance in child outcomes.
en-000007614	Parenting styles, according to Kimberly Kopoko, are"based upon two aspects of parenting behavior; control and warmth.
en-000007615	Parental control refers to the degree to which parents manage their children's behavior.
en-000007616	Parental warmth refers to the degree to which parents are accepting and responsive of their children's behavior."
en-000007617	The following parenting styles have been described in the child development literature:
en-000007618	Parenting roles in child development have typically focused on the role of the mother.
en-000007619	Recent literature, however, has looked toward the father as having an important role in child development.
en-000007620	Having more than one of these figures contributes to a higher likelihood of positive child outcomes.
en-000007621	Another parental factor often debated in terms of its effects on child development is divorce.
en-000007622	Divorce in itself is not a determining factor of negative child outcomes.
en-000007623	In fact, the majority of children from divorcing families fall into the normal range on measures of psychological and cognitive functioning.
en-000007624	Additionally, direct parental relationship with the child also affects the development of a child after a divorce.
en-000007625	Overall, protective factors facilitating positive child development after a divorce are maternal warmth, positive father-child relationship, and cooperation between parents.
en-000007626	He was the first and most significant jazz talent to emerge from Europe.
en-000007627	Reinhardt's most popular compositions have become jazz standards, including "Minor Swing", "Daphne", "Belleville", "Djangology", "Swing'42", and "Nuages".
en-000007628	The birth certificate refers to "Jean Reinhart, son of Jean Baptiste Reinhart, artist, and Laurence Reinhart, housewife, domiciled in Paris".
en-000007629	Reinhardt was attracted to music at an early age, first playing the violin.
en-000007630	At the age of 12 he received a banjo-guitar as a gift.
en-000007631	He quickly learned to play, mimicking the fingerings of musicians he watched.
en-000007632	His first known recordings, made in 1927, were of him playing the banjo and guitar.
en-000007633	Reinhardt was able to make a living playing music by the time he was 15.
en-000007634	He received little formal education and acquired the rudiments of literacy only in adult life.
en-000007635	At the age of 17 Reinhardt married Florine "Bella" Mayer, a girl from the same gypsy settlement.
en-000007636	His right leg was paralyzed, and the fourth and fifth fingers of his left hand were badly burned.
en-000007637	After getting its fingers badly burned at the last election in 2004, Russia is clearly tempted to intervene again.
en-000007638	Doctors believed that he would never play guitar again, and they intended to amputate one of his legs.
en-000007639	By sheer will, he taught himself to overcome his now permanent handicap by using only his thumb and two fingers.
en-000007640	But partly as a result of the trauma and injuries, he and his wife divorced soon after.
en-000007641	His son later took the surname of his mother's new husband, Baumgartner.
en-000007642	His brother Joseph Reinhardt, also an accomplished guitarist, bought Django a new guitar.
en-000007643	With rehabilitation and practice, he relearned his craft in a completely new way.
en-000007644	The years between 1925 and 1933 were formative for Reinhardt, personally and musically.
en-000007645	He had divorced his wife and had formed a relationship with one of his distant cousins, Sophie Ziegler, nicknamed"Naguine.
en-000007646	One change during this period was his abandonment of the banjo in favor of the guitar.
en-000007647	The new sounds gave Reinhardt a vision and goal of becoming a jazz professional.
en-000007648	He later met Stéphane Grappelli, a young violinist with similar musical interests.
en-000007649	He used the volume and expressiveness of the instrument as integral elements of his style.
en-000007650	It became the most accomplished and innovative European jazz group of the period.
en-000007651	Reinhardt's brother Joseph and Roger Chaput also played on guitar, and Louis Vola was on bass.
en-000007652	He used three guitarists along with an accordion lead, violin, and bass.
en-000007653	He participated in a jam session and radio performance with Louis Armstrong.
en-000007654	Later in his career, Reinhardt played with Dizzy Gillespie in France.
en-000007655	In 1938 Reinhardt's quintet played to thousands at an all-star show held in London's Kilburn State auditorium.
en-000007656	When World War II broke out, the original quintet was on tour in the United Kingdom.
en-000007657	Grappelli remained in the United Kingdom for the duration of the war.
en-000007658	Reinhardt re-formed the quintet, with Hubert Rostaing on clarinet replacing Grappelli.
en-000007659	They had a son, Babik Reinhardt, who later became a respected guitarist in his own right.
en-000007660	In addition, the German attitude toward jazz from the time of World War I had been one of general hostility.
en-000007661	But beginning in 1933, all German Gypsies were doomed, states Dregni.
en-000007662	But he was stopped by Swiss border guards who forced him to return to Paris.
en-000007663	One of his songs, "Nuages," became an unofficial anthem in Paris to signify hope for liberation.
en-000007664	Since the Nazis officially disapproved of jazz, Reinhardt tried to develop other musical directions.
en-000007665	He played with many notable musicians and composers, such as Maury Deutsch.
en-000007666	He played a few tunes at the end of the show, backed by Ellington, with no special arrangements written for him.
en-000007667	After his return, Reinhardt became re-immersed in Gypsy life, finding it difficult to adjust to the postwar world.
en-000007668	He sometimes showed up for scheduled concerts without a guitar or amplifier, or wandered off to the park or beach.
en-000007669	On a few occasions he refused to get out of bed.
en-000007670	Reinhardt developed a reputation among his band, fans, and managers as being extremely unreliable.
en-000007671	He skipped sold-out concerts to "walk to the beach" or "smell the dew".
en-000007672	The recording was discovered in the late 1950s, when it was issued for the first time.
en-000007673	Back in Paris in June 1950, Reinhardt was invited to join an entourage to welcome the return of Benny Goodman.
en-000007674	He also attended a reception for Goodman, who after the war ended had asked Reinhardt to join him in the U.S.
en-000007675	In 1973 Stéphane Grappelli formed a successful Quintette-style band with the British guitarists Diz Disley and Denny Wright.
en-000007676	Grappelli formed many other musical partnerships, including collaborations with John Etheridge, Nigel Kennedy and David Grisman, and became very popular.
en-000007677	He influenced other musicians, such as the Dutch violinist Tim Kliphuis.
en-000007678	In 1951, Reinhardt retired to Samois-sur-Seine, near Fontainebleau, where he lived until his death.
en-000007679	He continued to play in Paris jazz clubs and began playing electric guitar.
en-000007680	(He often used a Selmer fitted with an electric pickup, despite his initial hesitation about the instrument.)
en-000007681	It was a Saturday and it took a full day for a doctor to arrive.
en-000007682	Reinhardt's second son, Babik, became a guitarist in the contemporary jazz style.
en-000007683	After Django died, his brother Joseph at first swore to abandon music, but he was persuaded to perform and record again.
en-000007684	Joseph's son Markus Reinhardt is a violinist in the Romani style.
en-000007685	Dallas Baumgartner, a great-grandson by Lousson, is a guitarist who travels with the Romani and keeps a low public profile.
en-000007686	Django had a distant relative, Schnuckenack Reinhardt, who was a violinist.
en-000007687	Many of his descendants, such as his grandson Lulo Reinhardt, are also involved in gypsy music.
en-000007688	For about a decade after Reinhardt's death, interest in his musical style was minimal.
en-000007689	In the fifties, bebop superseded swing in jazz, rock and roll took off, and electric instruments became dominant in popular music.
en-000007690	"Django was the definitive genius on the guitar, and the depth of his gift was so spectacular," says Allen.
en-000007691	Reinhardt's five-piece band initially played only strings, with three guitarists, a violinist and a bass player.
en-000007692	Guitarist Mike Peters notes that"the word'genius'is bantered about too much.
en-000007693	But in jazz, Louis Armstrong was a genius, Duke Ellington was another one, and Reinhardt was also."
en-000007694	In 1984 the Kool Jazz Festival, held in Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall, was dedicated entirely to Django.
en-000007695	Performers included Grappelli, Benny Carter, and Mike Peters with his group of seven musicians.
en-000007696	Jazz guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli from New Jersey performed a tribute concert in 2001.
en-000007697	Many guitar players and other musicians have expressed admiration for Reinhardt or have cited him as a major influence.
en-000007698	Jeff Beck described Reinhardt as "by far the most astonishing guitar player ever" and "quite superhuman".
en-000007699	Even today, nobody has really come to the state that he was playing at.
en-000007700	As good as players are, they haven’t gotten to where he is.
en-000007701	Foreign relations France includes the government's external relations with other countries and international organizations since the end of the Middle Ages.
en-000007702	France played the single most important role in European diplomacy and warfare before 1815.
en-000007703	France was on the winning side of the First World War, but fared poorly in the Second World War.
en-000007704	It fought numerous expensive wars, usually to protect its voice in the selection of monarchs in neighboring countries.
en-000007705	A high priority was blocking the growth of power of the Habsburg rivals who controlled Austria and Spain.
en-000007706	Warfare defined the foreign policies of Louis XIV, and his personality shaped his approach.
en-000007707	Impelled "by a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique," Louis sensed that warfare was the ideal way to enhance his glory.
en-000007708	He taught his diplomats their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military.
en-000007709	While his battlefield generals were not especially good, Louis XIV had excellent support staff.
en-000007710	His chief engineer Vauban (1633-1707) perfected the arts of fortifying French towns and besieging enemy cities.
en-000007711	The finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–83) dramatically improved the financial system so that it could support an army of 250,000 men.
en-000007712	But America’s financial system has changed dramatically since the 1930’s.
en-000007713	The system deteriorated under Louis XV so that wars drained the increasingly inefficient financial system.
en-000007714	There were also two lesser conflicts: the War of Devolution and the War of the Reunions.
en-000007715	However France was badly defeated in the Seven Years'War (1754-1763) and forced to give up its holdings in North America.
en-000007716	A few scholars defend Louis, arguing that his highly negative reputation was based on propaganda meant to justify the French Revolution.
en-000007717	Jerome Blum described him as "a perpetual adolescent called to do a man's job."
en-000007718	France played a key role helping the American Patriots win their War of Independence against Britain 1775–1783.
en-000007719	In 1777, American captured the British invasion army at Saratoga, demonstrating the viability of their revolt.
en-000007720	By 1789, the French debt acquired to fight in that war came to a staggering 1.3 billion livres.
en-000007721	Benjamin Franklin served as the American ambassador to France from 1776 to 1785.
en-000007722	He met with many leading diplomats, aristocrats, intellectuals, scientists and financiers.
en-000007723	Following their victory at Fleurus, the French occupied Belgium and the Rhineland.
en-000007724	Finally, a peace agreement was concluded between France, Spain, and Prussia in 1795 at Basel.
en-000007725	By 1799 Napoleon had seized power in France and proved highly adept at warfare and coalition building.
en-000007726	In 1806 Prussia joined Britain and Russia, thus forming the Fourth Coalition.
en-000007727	Napoleon was not alone since he now had a complex network of allies and subject states.
en-000007728	There the Russian Empire was defeated at the Battle of Friedland (14 June 1807).
en-000007729	The Duchy of Warsaw was formed over these territorial losses, and Polish troops entered the Grande Armée in significant numbers.
en-000007730	Only two countries remained neutral in the war: Sweden and Portugal, and Napoleon then looked toward the latter.
en-000007731	In the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807), a Franco-Spanish alliance against Portugal was sealed as Spain eyed Portuguese territories.
en-000007732	French armies entered Spain in order to attack Portugal, but then seized Spanish fortresses and took over the kingdom by surprise.
en-000007733	Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother, was made King of Spain after Charles IV abdicated.
en-000007734	Another French attack was launched on Spain, led by Napoleon himself, and was described as "an avalanche of fire and steel."
en-000007735	However, the French Empire was no longer regarded as invincible by European powers.
en-000007736	In 1808 Austria formed the War of the Fifth Coalition in order to break down the French Empire.
en-000007737	The French invasion of Russia (1812) Was a total disaster, caused primarily by weather, partisan attacks, disease and inadequate logistics.
en-000007738	On the Spanish front the French armies were defeated and evacuated Spain.
en-000007739	Since France had been defeated on these two fronts, states it previously conquered and controlled struck back.
en-000007740	The Sixth Coalition was formed, and the German states of the Confederation of the Rhine switched sides, finally opposing Napoleon.
en-000007741	Napoleon was defeated in the Battle of the Nations outside Leipzig in October 1813.
en-000007742	The Allies invaded France and Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814.
en-000007743	The conservative Congress of Vienna reversed the political changes that had occurred during the wars.
en-000007744	The monarchy was restored with Louis XVIII as king, followed by his brother.
en-000007745	However much of the Napoleonic liberalization of Western Europe, including Italy, and Germany, and adjacent areas became permanent
en-000007746	Despite his promises in 1852 of a peaceful reign, Napoleon III could not resist the temptations of glory in foreign affairs.
en-000007747	He was visionary, mysterious and secretive; he had a poor staff, and kept running afoul of his domestic supporters.
en-000007748	He facilitated a French company building the Suez Canal, which Britain could not stop.
en-000007749	War with Austria in 1859 facilitated the unification of Italy, and Napoleon was rewarded with the annexation of Savoy and Nice.
en-000007750	The British grew annoyed at his intervention in Syria in 1860-61.
en-000007751	It was disastrously defeated on the battlefield, losing Alsace and Lorraine.
en-000007752	The Second French Empire under Napoleon III remained officially neutral throughout the War and never recognized the Confederate States of America.
en-000007753	France was reluctant to act alone without British collaboration, and the British rejected intervention.
en-000007754	Emperor Napoleon III realized that a war with the U.S. without allies "would spell disaster" for France.
en-000007755	Napoleon III and his Minister of Foreign Affairs Edouard Thouvenel adopted a cautious attitude and maintained diplomatically correct relations with Washington.
en-000007756	Half the French press favored the Union, while the "imperial" press was more sympathetic to the Confederacy.
en-000007757	Public opinion generally ignored the war, showing much interest in Mexico.
en-000007758	In 1861, Mexican conservatives looked to French leader Napoleon III to abolish the Republic led by liberal President Benito Juárez.
en-000007759	France favored the Confederacy but did not accord it diplomatic recognition.
en-000007760	The French expected that a Confederate victory would facilitate French economic dominance in Mexico.
en-000007761	he helped The Confederacy by shipping urgently needed supplies through the ports of Matamoros, Mexico, and Brownsville (Texas).
en-000007762	Juarez turned them down, but the Confederates worked well with local warlords in northern Mexico, and with the French invaders.
en-000007763	Napoleon III had no choice but to withdrew his outnumbered army in disgrace.
en-000007764	Emperor Maximilian refused exile and was executed by the Mexican government in 1867.
en-000007765	In the midst of the Scramble for Africa, French and British interest in Africa came into conflict.
en-000007766	Under heavy pressure the French withdrew securing Anglo-Egyptian control over the area.
en-000007767	In 1882, ongoing civil disturbances in Egypt prompted Britain to intervene, extending a hand to France.
en-000007768	France had colonies in Asia and looked for alliances and found in Japan a possible ally.
en-000007769	At Japan's request Paris sent military missions in 1872–1880, in 1884–1889 and in 1918–1919 to help modernize the Japanese army.
en-000007770	Conflicts with China over Indochina climaxed during the Sino-French War (1884–1885).
en-000007771	Under the leadership of expansionist Jules Ferry, the Third Republic greatly expanded the French colonial empire.
en-000007772	France acquired Indochina, Madagascar, vast territories in West Africa and Central Africa, and much of Polynesia.
en-000007773	Germany then invaded Belgium and France, and the World War I had begun.
en-000007774	France suffered very heavy losses, in terms of battle casualties and economic distress but came out on the winning side.
en-000007775	Appeasement say Martin Thomas was not a coherent diplomatic strategy or a copying of the British.
en-000007776	France appeased Italy on the Ethiopia question because it could not afford to risk an alliance between Italy and Germany.
en-000007777	The fall of France in June 1940 brought a new regime known as Vichy France.
en-000007778	Theoretically it was neutral, and maintained formal relationships with the United States.
en-000007779	It was heavily influenced by Germany until November 1942, when Germany took full control.
en-000007780	Though the UK was invited, its Labour government, then preparing for a re-election fight, did not join the initiative.
en-000007781	Among these states the ECSC would remove trade barriers and create a common market for coal and steel.
en-000007782	The ECSC was governed by a'High Authority', checked by bodies representing governments, Members of Parliament and an independent judiciary.
en-000007783	His top priority was ending the war in Indochina, which had already cost 92,000 dead 114,000 wounded and 28,000 captured.
en-000007784	However, the United States moved in and provided large scale financial military and economic support for South Vietnam.
en-000007785	The National Assembly brought him back to power during the May 1958 crisis.
en-000007786	De Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic with a strengthened presidency, and he was elected in the latter role.
en-000007787	He granted independence to Algeria in 1962 and progressively to other French colonies.
en-000007788	He twice vetoed Britain's entry into the Common Market, fearing it might overshadow France in European affairs.
en-000007789	He launched an independent nuclear development program that made France the fourth nuclear power.
en-000007790	He was angry at American economic power, especially what his Finance minister called the "exorbitant privilege" of the U.S. dollar.
en-000007791	He went to Canada and proclaimed "Vive le Québec libre", The catchphrase for an independent Quebec.
en-000007792	De Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a referendum in which he proposed more decentralization.
en-000007793	He had a warm and effective relationship with the conservative German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
en-000007794	They promoted French-German bilateralism in Europe And strengthened military cooperation between the two countries.
en-000007795	According to some sources, Sarkozy himself asked for Uribe to release FARC's "chancellor" Rodrigo Granda.
en-000007796	The contract was the first made by Libya since 2004, and was negotiated with MBDA, a subsidiary of EADS.
en-000007797	Another 128 million euros contract would have been signed, according to Tripoli, with EADS for a TETRA radio system.
en-000007798	The Socialist Party (PS) and the Communist Party (PCF) criticized a "state affair" and a "barter" with a "Rogue state".
en-000007799	The leader of the PS, François Hollande, requested the opening of a parliamentary investigation.
en-000007800	He then pushed forward the important Socialist figure of Dominique Strauss-Kahn as European nominee to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
en-000007801	He takes a hard line with regard to the Greek debt crisis.
en-000007802	Under President Hollande, France's stances on the civil war in Syria and Iran's nuclear program has been described as "hawkish".
en-000007803	France established relations with the Middle East during the reign of Louis XIV.
en-000007804	In 1869 Egyptian workers-under the supervision of France- completed the Suez Canal.
en-000007805	After the unification of Germany in 1871, Germany successfully attempted to co-op France's relations with the Ottomans.
en-000007806	In World War I the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers, and was defeated by France and Britain.
en-000007807	After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire France and Britain divided the Middle East between themselves.
en-000007808	Relationships with Syria are more strained, due to the policies of that country.
en-000007809	In 2005, France, along with the United States, pressured Syria to evacuate Lebanon.
en-000007810	In the post-World War II era French relations with the Arab Middle East reached a very low point.
en-000007811	The war in Algeria between Muslim fighters and French colonists deeply concerned the rest of the Muslim world.
en-000007812	The Algerian fighters received much of their supplies and funding from Egypt and other Arab powers, much to France's displeasure.
en-000007813	Another hindrance to France's relations with the Arab Middle East was its close alliance with Israel during the 1950s.
en-000007814	This all changed with the coming of Charles de Gaulle to power.
en-000007815	The former French colonies in eastern and northern Africa were quite agreeable to these close relations with France.
en-000007816	These nations had close economic and cultural ties to France, and they also had few other suitors amongst the major powers.
en-000007817	This new orientation of French foreign policy also appealed strongly to the leaders of the Arab nations.
en-000007818	De Gaulle hoped to use this common foundation to build strong relations between the nations.
en-000007819	He also hoped that good relations would improve France's trade with the region.
en-000007820	The end of the Algerian conflict in 1962 accomplished much in this regard.
en-000007821	The Middle Eastern support for the FLN guerillas was another strain on relations that the end of the conflict removed.
en-000007822	This was especially true of Nasser's Egypt, which had long supported the separatists.
en-000007823	Egypt is also the most direct example of improved relations after the end of hostilities.
en-000007824	De Gaulle and his ministers reacted very harshly to Israel's actions in the Six Day War.
en-000007825	Most importantly of all, however, de Gaulle's government imposed an arms embargo on the Israeli state.
en-000007826	As early as 1970 France sold Libya a hundred Dassault Mirage fighter jets.
en-000007827	Nasser and de Gaulle, who shared many similarities, cooperated on limiting American power in the region.
en-000007828	Nasser proclaimed France as the only friend of Egypt in the West.
en-000007829	France improved relations with its former colony Syria, and eroded cultural links were partially restored.
en-000007830	In terms of trade France did receive some benefits from the improved relations with the Middle East.
en-000007831	French trade with the Middle East increased by over fifty percent after de Gaulle's reforms.
en-000007832	Relations between post-colonial Algeria and France have remained close throughout the years, although sometimes difficult.
en-000007833	In 1962, the Evian Accords peace treaty laid the foundations of a new Franco-Algerian relationship.
en-000007834	Economically, France enjoyed a preferential treatment vis-à-vis the Saharan wealth of hydrocarbons.
en-000007835	Militarily, it could keep the Mers-el-Kébir base for 15 years and use the Saharan nuclear test-sites for another five years.
en-000007836	France had used these sites to carry out its first nuclear tests ("Gerboise bleue") in 1960.
en-000007837	We struggled against French rule for 15 years under the leadership of Emir Abdel-Kader Al-Jazairi.
en-000007838	It is a big difference with the Anglo-Saxon countries, where post-colonial studies are now in all the universities.
en-000007839	According to Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin, "speaking about the past or writing history is not the job of the parliament."
en-000007840	The issue of the French human rights record in Algeria is also politically sensitive in Turkey.
en-000007841	Turkish party leaders, including CHP, MHP, BBP and ANAP called on France to recognize what they called "Algerian genocide".
en-000007842	In those former colonies where the French presence remains important, France contributes to political, military, and social stability.
en-000007843	France was instrumental in launching the Asia–Europe Meeting (ASEM) process which could eventually emerge as a competitor to APEC.
en-000007844	In Southeast Asia, France was an architect of the Paris Peace Accords, which ended the conflict in Cambodia.
en-000007845	North Korea however maintains a "delegation" (not an embassy nor a consulate) near Paris.
en-000007846	Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stoker’s "Dracula".
en-000007847	The name "Gothic" refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place.
en-000007848	This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany.
en-000007849	The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German "Schauerroman" and the French "Georgia".
en-000007850	The novel usually regarded as the "first Gothic novel" is Horace Walpole's "The Castle of Otranto", first published in 1764.
en-000007851	Walpole published the first edition disguised as a medieval romance from Italy discovered and republished by a fictitious translator.
en-000007852	When Walpole admitted to his authorship in the second edition, its originally favourable reception by literary reviewers changed into rejection.
en-000007853	A romance with superstitious elements, and moreover void of didactical intention, was considered a setback and not acceptable.
en-000007854	Radcliffe's novels, above all "The Mysteries of Udolpho" (1794), were best-sellers.
en-000007855	However, along with most novels at the time, they were looked down upon by many well-educated people as sensationalist nonsense.
en-000007856	Romantic literary movements developed in continental Europe concurrent with the development of the Gothic novel.
en-000007857	The "roman noir" ("black novel") appeared in France, by such writers as François Guillaume Ducray-Duminil, Baculard d'Arnaud and Madame de Genlis.
en-000007858	These works were often more horrific and violent than the English Gothic novel.
en-000007859	"The Monk " also influenced Ann Radcliffe in her last novel,"The Italian" (1797).
en-000007860	Sade considered "The Monk" to be superior to the work of Ann Radcliffe.
en-000007861	German gothic fiction is usually described by the term Schauerroman ("shudder novel").
en-000007862	Heinrich Zschokke's "Abällino, der grosse Bandit" (1793) was translated into English by M.G.
en-000007863	Benedikte Naubert's novel "Hermann of Unna" (1788) is seen as being very close to the Schauerroman genre.
en-000007864	While the term "Schauerroman" is sometimes equated with the term "Gothic novel", this is only partially true.
en-000007865	However, Schauerroman's key elements are necromancy and secret societies and it is remarkably more pessimistic than the British Gothic novel.
en-000007866	All those elements are the basis for Friedrich von Schiller's unfinished novel "The Ghost-Seer" (1786–1789).
en-000007867	During the next two decades, the most famous author of Gothic literature in Germany was polymath E. T. A. Hoffmann.
en-000007868	His novel "The Devil's Elixirs" (1815) was influenced by Lewis's novel "The Monk", and even mentions it during the book.
en-000007869	After them, Wilhelm Meinhold wrote "The Amber Witch" (1838) and "Sidonia von Bork" (1847).
en-000007870	Also writing in the German language, Jeremias Gotthelf wrote "The Black Spider" (1842), an allegorical work that used Gothic themes.
en-000007871	The last work from German writer Theodor Storm, "The Rider on the White Horse" (1888), also uses Gothic motives and themes.
en-000007872	In the beginning of the 20th century, many German authors wrote works influenced by Schauerroman, including Hanns Heinz Ewers.
en-000007873	Russian Gothic was not, until recently, viewed as a critical label by Russian critics.
en-000007874	If used, the word "gothic" was used to describe (mostly early) works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky.
en-000007875	Most critics simply used the tags such as "Romanticism" and "fantastique".
en-000007876	The first Russian author whose work can be described as gothic fiction is considered to be Nikolay Mikhailovich Karamzin.
en-000007877	The term "gothic" is sometimes also used to describe the ballads of Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky (particularly "Ludmila" (1808) and "Svetlana" (1813)).
en-000007878	Grigory Petrovich Danilevsky, who wrote historical and early science fiction novels and stories, wrote "Mertvec-ubiytsa" ("Dead Murderer") in 1879.
en-000007879	Nobel Prize winner Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin wrote "Dry Valley" (1912), which is considered to be influenced by gothic literature.
en-000007880	Further contributions to the Gothic genre were seen in the work of the Romantic poets.
en-000007881	Byron features, under the codename of'Lord Ruthven', in Lady Caroline's own Gothic novel: "Glenarvon" (1816).
en-000007882	This occasion was productive of both Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" (1818) and Polidori's "The Vampyre" (1819).
en-000007883	This latter story revives Lamb's Byronic'Lord Ruthven', but this time as a vampire.
en-000007884	However, in many ways, it was now entering its most creative phase.
en-000007885	Reynolds who wrote a trilogy of Gothic horror novels: "Faust" (1846), "Wagner the Wehr-wolf" (1847) and "The Necromancer" (1857).
en-000007886	Another famous penny dreadful of this era was the anonymously authored "Varney the Vampire" (1847).
en-000007887	An important and innovative reinterpreter of the Gothic in this period was Edgar Allan Poe.
en-000007888	Poe's critics complained about his "German" tales, to which he replied,'that terror is not of Germany, but of the soul'.
en-000007889	Poe, a critic himself, believed that terror was a legitimate literary subject.
en-000007890	The influence of Byronic Romanticism evident in Poe is also apparent in the work of the Brontë sisters.
en-000007891	Emily's Cathy and Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre are both examples of female protagonists in such a role.
en-000007892	The most famous Gothic villain ever, Count Dracula, was created by Bram Stoker in his novel "Dracula" (1897).
en-000007893	Stoker's book also established Transylvania and Eastern Europe as the "locus classicus" of the Gothic.
en-000007894	Bierce's short stories were in the horrific and pessimistic tradition of Poe.
en-000007895	The conventions of Gothic literature did not spring from nowhere into the mind of Horace Walpole.
en-000007896	Gothic literature is often described with words such as "wonder" and "terror."
en-000007897	The edges of the map were being filled in, and no one was finding any dragons.
en-000007898	The setting of most early Gothic works was a medieval one, but this had been a common theme long before Walpole.
en-000007899	In Britain especially, there was a desire to reclaim a shared past.
en-000007900	This obsession frequently led to extravagant architectural displays, and sometimes mock tournaments were held.
en-000007901	However, Gothic literature was not the origin of this tradition; indeed it was far older.
en-000007902	Even earlier, poets like Edmund Spenser evoked a dreary and sorrowful mood in such poems as Epithalamion.
en-000007903	What was lacking was an aesthetic, which would serve to tie the elements together.
en-000007904	Specifically, Burke's thoughts on the Sublime, Terror, and Obscurity were most applicable.
en-000007905	Bloom asserts that Burke's descriptive vocabulary was essential to the Romantic works that eventually informed the Gothic.
en-000007906	The excesses, stereotypes, and frequent absurdities of the traditional Gothic made it rich territory for satire.
en-000007907	Jane Austen's novel is valuable for including a list of early Gothic works since known as the Northanger Horrid Novels.
en-000007908	Another example of Gothic parody in a similar vein is "The Heroine" by Eaton Stannard Barrett (1813).
en-000007909	Cherry Wilkinson, a fatuous female protagonist with a history of novel-reading, fancies herself as the heroine of a Gothic romance.
en-000007910	Lovecraft's protégé, Robert Bloch, contributed to "Weird Tales" and penned "Psycho" (1959), which drew on the classic interests of the genre.
en-000007911	Many were published under the Paperback Library Gothic imprint and were marketed to a female audience.
en-000007912	Though the authors were mostly women, some men wrote Gothic romances under female pseudonyms.
en-000007913	Another example is British writer Peter O'Donnell, who wrote under the pseudonym Madeleine Brent.
en-000007914	Outside of companies like Lovespell, who carry Colleen Shannon, very few books seem to be published using the term today.
en-000007915	Examples include William Faulkner, Eudora Welty, Truman Capote, Flannery O'Connor, Davis Grubb, and Harper Lee.
en-000007916	The Southern Ontario Gothic applies a similar sensibility to a Canadian cultural context.
en-000007917	This will never apply to Europe to a similar degree, given cultural and linguistic barriers.
en-000007918	Farrel's novels spawned a subgenre of "Grande Dame Guignol" in the cinema, dubbed the "psycho-biddy" genre.
en-000007919	"A Gothic Romance ", and was partly modelled on Matthew Lewis'"The Monk".
en-000007920	Other books by du Maurier, such as "Jamaica Inn" (1936), also display Gothic tendencies.
en-000007921	As such, the Gothic helps students better understand their own doubts about the self-assurance of today's scientists.
en-000007922	The themes of the literary Gothic have been translated into other media.
en-000007923	For example, heavy metal musician King Diamond delights in telling stories full of horror, theatricality, satanism and anti-Catholicism in his compositions.
en-000007924	Others, such as Ghosts'n Goblins feature a campier parody of Gothic fiction.
en-000007925	Gothic literature is intimately associated with the Gothic Revival architecture of the same era.
en-000007926	He also builds a tall tower in order to further his quest for knowledge.
en-000007927	This tower represents Vathek's pride and his desire for a power that is beyond the reach of humans.
en-000007928	He is later warned that he must destroy the tower and return to Islam or else risk dire consequences.
en-000007929	Vathek’s pride wins out and, in the end, his quest for power and knowledge ends with him confined to Hell.
en-000007930	In the "Castle of Wolfenbach" the castle that Matilda seeks refuge at while on the run is believed to be haunted.
en-000007931	Matilda’s discovery of the Countess and her subsequent informing others of the Countess's presence destroys the Count's secret.
en-000007932	On the other end of the spectrum was the beautiful, which were those things that brought pleasure and safety.
en-000007933	Burke argued that the sublime was the more preferred to the two.
en-000007934	On the other hand, the abbey also serves as a comfort, as it provides shelter and safety to the characters.
en-000007935	As with many of the buildings in Gothic novels, the abbey also has a series of tunnels.
en-000007936	These tunnels serve as both a hiding place for the characters and as a place of secrets.
en-000007937	Characterized by its castles, dungeons, gloomy forests and hidden passages, from the Gothic novel genre emerged the Female Gothic.
en-000007938	Significantly, with the development of the Female Gothic came the literary technique of "explaining the supernatural".
en-000007939	The novel sets up suspense for horrific events, which all have natural explanations.
en-000007940	Radcliffe’s use of Supernatural Explained is characteristic of the Gothic author.
en-000007941	The female protagonists pursued in these texts are often caught in an unfamiliar and terrifying landscape, delivering higher degrees of horror.
en-000007942	English scholar Chloe Chard’s published introduction to "The Romance of the Forest" refers to the "promised effect of terror".
en-000007943	The outcome, however, "may prove less horrific than the novel has originally suggested".
en-000007944	While Adeline is alone in her characteristically Gothic chamber, she detects something supernatural, or mysterious about the setting.
en-000007945	Novels were an experience for these women who had no outlet for a thrilling excursion.
en-000007946	Sexual encounters and superstitious fantasies were idle elements of the imagination.
en-000007947	"The heroine possesses the romantic temperament that perceives strangeness where others see none.
en-000007948	Her sensibility, therefore, prevents her from knowing that her true plight is her condition, the disability of being female."
en-000007949	This Female Gothic text by Parsons is listed as one of Catherine Morland's Gothic texts in Austen's "Northanger Abbey".
en-000007950	Matilda, being the courageous heroine, decides to explore the mysterious wing of the Castle.
en-000007951	The modern territory of Albania had no counterpart in the standard political divisions of classical antiquity.
en-000007952	The territory remained under Roman and Byzantine control until the Slavic migrations of the 7th century.
en-000007953	It was integrated into the Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century.
en-000007954	The area was part of the Serbian Empire, but passed to the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century.
en-000007955	A short-lived monarchical state known as the Principality of Albania (1914–1925) was succeeded by an even shorter-lived first Albanian Republic (1925–1928).
en-000007956	The country endured an occupation by Italy just prior to World War II.
en-000007957	The unstable economic situation led to an Albanian diaspora, mostly to Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Germany and North America during the 1990s.
en-000007958	A part of this population later moved to Mycenae around 1600 BC and founded the Mycenaean civilisation there.
en-000007959	The latter derived from early an Indo-European presence in the western Balkan Peninsula.
en-000007960	Around 230 BC, the Ardiaei briefly attained military might under the reign of king Agron.
en-000007961	He raided parts of Epirus, Epidamnus, and the islands of Corcyra and Pharos.
en-000007962	His state stretched from Narona in Dalmatia south to the river Aoos and Corcyra.
en-000007963	During his reign, the Ardiaean Kingdom reached the height of its power.
en-000007964	The Ardiaean army and fleet made it a major regional power in the Balkans and the southern Adriatic.
en-000007965	The king regained control of the Adriatic with his warships ("lembi"), a domination once enjoyed by the Liburnians.
en-000007966	Around 231 BC, Agron suddenly died after his triumph over the Aetolians.
en-000007967	Agron's (second) wife was Queen Teuta, who acted as regent after Agron's death.
en-000007968	Teuta started to address the neighbouring states malevolently, supporting the piratical raids of her subjects.
en-000007969	Later on, in 229 BC, she clashed with the Romans and initiated the Illyrian Wars.
en-000007970	After his defeat, the Romans split the region into three administrative divisions, called "meris".
en-000007971	Beginning in the 7th century BC, Greek colonies were established on the Illyrian coast.
en-000007972	The most important were Apollonia, Avlona (modern-day Vlorë), Epidamnos (modern-day Durrës), and Lissus (modern-day Lezhë).
en-000007973	At that time, it was considered an unimportant outpost, overshadowed by Apollonia and Epidamnos.
en-000007974	The western part of the Via Egnatia ran inside modern Albania, ending at Dyrrachium.
en-000007975	Illyricum was later divided into the provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia.
en-000007976	The Roman province of "Illyricum" or "Illyris Romana" or "Illyris Barbara" or "Illyria Barbara" replaced most of the region of Illyria.
en-000007977	The regions which it included changed through the centuries though a great part of ancient Illyria remained part of Illyricum.
en-000007978	South Illyria became Epirus Nova, part of the Roman province of Macedonia.
en-000007979	Most of the region of modern Albania corresponds to the Epirus Nova.
en-000007980	Christianity came to Epirus nova, then part of the Roman province of Macedonia.
en-000007981	This split marked the first significant religious fragmentation of the country.
en-000007982	Thereafter, only the dioceses in inner Albania (Elbasan, Krujë) remained attached to Ohrid.
en-000007983	In the 13th century during the Venetian occupation, the Latin Archdiocese of Durrës was founded.
en-000007984	Beginning in the first decades of Byzantine rule (until 461), the region suffered devastating raids by Visigoths, Huns, and Ostrogoths.
en-000007985	In the 6th and 7th centuries, the region experienced an influx of Slavs.
en-000007986	In general, the invaders destroyed or weakened Roman and Byzantine cultural centres in the lands that would become Albania.
en-000007987	The Byzantines however managed to recover most of Albania by 1274, leaving only Valona and Dyrrhachium in Charles'hands.
en-000007988	Finally, when Charles launched his much-delayed advance, it was stopped at the Siege of Berat in 1280–1281.
en-000007989	In the mid-9th century most of eastern Albania became part of the Bulgarian Empire.
en-000007990	A later reference to Albanians from the same Attaliates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion around 1078, is undisputed.
en-000007991	In 1190 the first Albanian medieval state, the Principality of Arbër was founded by "archon" Progon in the region of Kruja.
en-000007992	Arbanon extended over the modern districts of central Albania, with its capital located at Kruja.
en-000007993	In 1204, after Western crusaders sacked Constantinople, Venice won nominal control over parts of Albania and took possession of Durrës.
en-000007994	Before 1204, Arbanon was an autonomous principality of the Byzantine Empire.
en-000007995	The titles "archon" (held by Progon) and "panhypersebastos" (held by Dhimiter) are examples of Byzantine dependence.
en-000007996	After 1204, the Albanians naturally followed the Despotate of Epirus, the successor of the Byzantine Empire.
en-000007997	The rulers were connected to the Serbian Nemanjić dynasty, through marriage and alliances.
en-000007998	He is last mentioned in the sources among other local leaders, in a meeting with George Akropolites in Durrës in 1256.
en-000007999	Arbanon was a beneficiary of the Via Egnatia trade road, which brought wealth and benefits from the more developed Byzantine civilization.
en-000008000	The southern part was governed by the semi-independent, Serbian ruled Despotate of Epiros.
en-000008001	According to some scholars, Progon's realm was the first Albanian state during the Middle Ages.
en-000008002	Along with the Serbian ruled Albania, there was also the Principality of Arbër, and later the Angevin Kingdom of Albania.
en-000008003	After the failure of the Eighth Crusade, Charles of Anjou turned his attention to Albania.
en-000008004	He began contacting local Albanian leaders through the local Catholic clergy, two priests acting as negotiators.
en-000008005	During 1271 they made several trips between Albania and Italy eventually succeeding in their mission.
en-000008006	The kingdom extended from the region of Dyrrhachium (Durrës) south along the coast to Butrint.
en-000008007	King Charles sought to launch an expedition against Constantinople, and in 1272–73 sent large provisions to Durrës and Vlorë.
en-000008008	This alarmed Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, who tried to convince Albanian nobility to switch sides.
en-000008009	However, the Albanian nobles remained loyal, and throughout the existence of the kingdom there was a conflict with the Byzantine Empire.
en-000008010	Karl Topia, who declared himself an Angevin descendant, captured Durrës and established the Principality of Albania.
en-000008011	During Angevin rule, Catholicism saw rapid spread among the population which affected the society as well as architecture.
en-000008012	A Western type of feudalism was introduced and it replaced the Byzantine Pronoia.
en-000008013	In the late 14th and the early 15th century the Ottoman Empire conquered parts of south and central Albania.
en-000008014	The main members of the league were the Arianiti, Balšić, Dukagjini, Muzaka, Spani, Thopia and Crnojevići.
en-000008015	Ottoman supremacy in the west Balkan region began in 1385 with their success in the Battle of Savra.
en-000008016	In 1419 Gjirokastra became the administrative centre of the Sanjak of Albania.
en-000008017	Beginning in the late-14th century, the Ottomans expanded their empire from Anatolia to much of the Balkans (Rumelia).
en-000008018	During the early phases of the revolt, many land (timar) holders were killed or expelled.
en-000008019	Major combatants included members of the Dukagjini, Zenebishi, Thopia, Kastrioti and Arianiti families.
en-000008020	In the initial phase,the rebels were successful in capturing some major towns such as Dagnum.
en-000008021	Ottoman forces conducted a number of massacres in the aftermath of the revolt.
en-000008022	After his desertion, Skanderbeg re-converted to Christianity and declared war against the Ottoman Empire, which he led from 1443 to 1468.
en-000008023	Skanderbeg summoned the Albanian princes to the Venetian-controlled town of Lezhë where they formed the League of Lezhë.
en-000008024	After his death the rebellion continued, but without its former success.
en-000008025	"See also: Islamization of Albania, Scutari Vilayet, Janina Vilayet, Kosovo Vilayet, Pashalik of Scutari, Pashalik of Berat, Pashalik of Janina
en-000008026	Many Albanians won fame and fortune as soldiers, administrators, and merchants in far-flung parts of the Empire.
en-000008027	Albania would be a part of the Ottoman Empire until the early 20th century.
en-000008028	Part of the Albanian population gradually converted to Islam, with many joining the Sufi Order of the Bektashi.
en-000008029	Converting from Christianity to Islam brought considerable advantages, including access to Ottoman trade networks, bureaucratic positions and the army.
en-000008030	As a result, many Albanians came to serve in the elite Janissary and the administrative Devşirme system.
en-000008031	No fewer than 42 Grand Viziers of the Empire were of Albanian descent.
en-000008032	Albania would remain a part of the Ottoman Empire as the provinces of Scutari, Monastir and Janina until 1912.
en-000008033	By the 1870s, the Sublime Porte's reforms aimed at checking the Ottoman Empire's disintegration had clearly failed.
en-000008034	Albanian émigrés in Bulgaria, Egypt, Italy, Romania and the United States supported the writing and distribution of Albanian textbooks and writings.
en-000008035	These revolts included the Albanian Revolts of 1833-1839, the Revolt of 1843–44, and the Revolt of 1847.
en-000008036	A culmination of the Albanian National Awakening was the League of Prizren.
en-000008037	The league was formed at a meeting of 47 Ottoman beys in Prizren on 18 June 1878.
en-000008038	An initial position of the league was presented in a document known as Kararname.
en-000008039	In August 1878, the Congress of Berlin ordered a commission to determine the border between the Ottoman Empire and Montenegro.
en-000008040	Finally, the Great Powers blockaded Ulcinj by sea and pressured the Ottoman authorities to bring the Albanians under control.
en-000008041	The League's founding figure Abdyl Frashëri influenced the League to demand autonomy and wage open war against the Ottomans.
en-000008042	The League of Prizren's leaders and their families were arrested and deported.
en-000008043	Frashëri, who originally received a death sentence, was imprisoned until 1885 and exiled until his death seven years later.
en-000008044	Zeka was assassinated by a Serbian agent Adem Zajmi in 1902.
en-000008045	This flag was sewn after Skanderbeg's principality flag, which had been used more than 400 years earlier.
en-000008046	Albanian independence was recognized by the Conference of London on 29 July 1913.
en-000008047	The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 awarded the area to Greece.
en-000008048	However the area definitively reverted to Albanian control in November 1921, following Greece's defeat in the Greco-Turkish War.
en-000008049	The Muslims also banned polygamy and allowed women to choose whether or not they wanted to wear a veil.
en-000008050	The security was to be provided by a Gendarmerie commanded by Dutch officers.
en-000008051	World War I interrupted all government activities in Albania, while the country was split in a number of regional governments.
en-000008052	Political chaos engulfed Albania after the outbreak of World War I.
en-000008053	The Albanian people split along religious and tribal lines after the prince's departure.
en-000008054	Muslims demanded a Muslim prince and looked to Turkey as the protector of the privileges they had enjoyed.
en-000008055	Still others, including many beys and clan chiefs, recognized no superior authority.
en-000008056	William subsequently joined the German army and served on the Eastern Front, but never renounced his claim to the throne.
en-000008057	In late 1914, Greece occupied the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus, including Korçë and Gjirokastër.
en-000008058	Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian forces then occupied about two-thirds of the country (Bulgarian occupation of Albania).
en-000008059	Serbia and Montenegro were promised much of northern Albania, and Greece was promised much of the country's southern half.
en-000008060	The treaty left a tiny Albanian state that would be represented by Italy in its relations with the other major powers.
en-000008061	After World War I, Albania was still under the occupation of Serbian and Italian forces.
en-000008062	Albania's political confusion continued in the wake of World War I.
en-000008063	Italian forces controlled Albanian political activity in the areas they occupied.
en-000008064	Serbian troops conducted actions in Albanian-populated border areas, while Albanian guerrillas operated in both Serbia and Montenegro.
en-000008065	In February 1920, the government moved to Tirana, which became Albania's capital.
en-000008066	One month later, in March 1920, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson intervened to block the Paris agreement.
en-000008067	Albania achieved a degree of statehood after World War I, in part because of the diplomatic intercession of the United States.
en-000008068	Between July and December 1921 alone, the premiership changed hands five times.
en-000008069	Ideologically, the Democrats included a broad sweep of people who advocated everything from conservative Islam to Noli's dreams of rapid modernization.
en-000008070	Zogu's party handily won elections for a National Assembly in early 1924.
en-000008071	Noli's supporters blamed the Rustemi murder on Zogu's Mati clansmen, who continued to practice blood vengeance.
en-000008072	After the walkout, discontent mounted, and in June 1924 a peasant-backed insurgency had won control of Tirana.
en-000008073	Fan Noli, an idealist, rejected demands for new elections on the grounds that Albania needed a "paternal" government.
en-000008074	In a manifesto describing his government's program, Noli called for abolishing feudalism, resisting Italian domination, and establishing a Western-style constitutional government.
en-000008075	Noli criticized the League of Nations for failing to settle the threat facing Albania on its land borders.
en-000008076	On 13 December 1924, Zogu's Yugoslav-backed army crossed into Albanian territory.
en-000008077	By Christmas Eve, Zogu had reclaimed the capital, and Noli and his government had fled to Italy.
en-000008078	The Constitution provided for a parliamentary republic with a powerful president serving as head of state and government.
en-000008079	On 31 January, Zogu was elected president for a seven-year term.
en-000008080	Opposition parties and civil liberties disappeared; opponents of the regime were murdered; and the press suffered strict censorship.
en-000008081	Zogu ruled Albania using four military governors responsible to him alone.
en-000008082	Zogu, however, quickly turned his back on Belgrade and looked instead to Benito Mussolini's Italy for patronage.
en-000008083	Under Zogu, Albania joined the Italian coalition against Yugoslavia of Kingdom of Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria in 1924–1927.
en-000008084	After the United Kingdom's and France's political intervention in 1927 with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the alliance crumbled.
en-000008085	Zogu maintained good relations with Benito Mussolini's fascist regime in Italy and supported Italy's foreign policy.
en-000008086	He would be the first and only Albanian to hold the title of president until 1991.
en-000008087	In 1928 the country's parliament declared Albania a kingdom with Zogu as King.
en-000008088	For example, in an attempt at social modernisation the custom of adding one's region to one's name was dropped.
en-000008089	Zog also made donations of land to international organisations for the building of schools and hospitals.
en-000008090	In 1928 Zogu secured the parliament's consent to its own dissolution.
en-000008091	A new constituent assembly amended the constitution, making Albania a kingdom and transforming Zogu into Zog I, "King of the Albanians."
en-000008092	The king's loyalists disarmed all of Albania's tribes except for his own Mati tribesmen and their allies, the Dibra.
en-000008093	Zog remained sensitive to steadily mounting disillusion with Italy's domination of Albania.
en-000008094	As a counterweight, Zog kept British officers in the Gendarmerie despite strong Italian pressure to remove them.
en-000008095	In 1931 Zog openly stood up to the Italians, refusing to renew the 1926 First Treaty of Tirana.
en-000008096	By June 1934, Albania had signed trade agreements with Yugoslavia and Greece, and Mussolini had suspended all payments to Tirana.
en-000008097	In 1935 he presented the Albanian government 3 million gold francs as a gift.
en-000008098	Soon Italians began taking positions in Albania's civil service, and Italian settlers were allowed into the country.
en-000008099	Mussolini's forces overthrew King Zog when Italy invaded Albania in 1939.
en-000008100	The nation thus became one of the first to be occupied by the Axis Powers in World War II.
en-000008101	At the same time, the colonization of Albania by Italians was encouraged.
en-000008102	In addition, Albania could provide Italy with a beachhead in the Balkans.
en-000008103	Before World War I Italy and Austria-Hungary had been instrumental in the creation of an independent Albanian state.
en-000008104	When Mussolini took power in Italy he turned with renewed interest to Albania.
en-000008105	Italy began penetration of Albania's economy in 1925, when Albania agreed to allow it to exploit its mineral resources.
en-000008106	Despite strong Italian influence, Zog refused to completely give in to Italian pressure.
en-000008107	In 1931 he openly stood up to the Italians, refusing to renew the 1926 Treaty of Tirana.
en-000008108	As Nazi Germany annexed Austria and moved against Czechoslovakia, Italy saw itself becoming a second-rate member of the Axis.
en-000008109	The imminent birth of an Albanian royal child meanwhile threatened to give Zog a lasting dynasty.
en-000008110	Italy's King Victor Emmanuel III criticized the plan to take Albania as an unnecessary risk.
en-000008111	Rome, however, delivered Tirana an ultimatum on 25 March 1939, demanding that it accede to Italy's occupation of Albania.
en-000008112	Zog refused to accept money in exchange for countenancing a full Italian takeover and colonization of Albania.
en-000008113	The invasion force was divided into three groups, which were to land successively.
en-000008114	Despite some stubborn resistance by some patriots, especially at Durrës, the Italians made short work of the Albanians.
en-000008115	The parliament elected Albania's largest landowner, Shefqet Bej Verlaci, as Prime Minister.
en-000008116	While Victor Emmanuel ruled as king, Shefqet Bej Verlaci served as the Prime Minister.
en-000008117	On 3 December 1941, Shefqet Bej Verlaci was replaced as Prime Minister and Head of State by Mustafa Merlika Kruja.
en-000008118	From the start, Albanian foreign affairs, customs, as well as natural resources came under direct control of Italy.
en-000008119	In October 1940, during the Greco-Italian War, Albania served as a staging-area for Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's unsuccessful invasion of Greece.
en-000008120	In April 1941, after Greece capitulated to the German forces, the Greek territorial gains in southern Albania returned to Italian command.
en-000008121	Under Italian command came also large areas of Greece after the successful German invasion of Greece.
en-000008122	The Albanian fascists claimed in May 1941 that nearly all the Albanian populated territories were united to Albania (see map).
en-000008123	After the surrender of the Italian Army in September 1943, Albania was occupied by the Germans.
en-000008124	The German Army soon drove the guerrillas into the hills and to the south.
en-000008125	Rather, they sought to gain popular support by backing causes popular with Albanians, especially the annexation of Kosovo.
en-000008126	The capital Tirana was liberated by the partisans on 17 November 1944 after a 20-day battle.
en-000008127	The Albanian partisans also liberated Kosovo, part of Montenegro, and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina.
en-000008128	Enver Hoxha became the leader of the country by virtue of his position as Secretary General of the Albanian Communist Party.
en-000008129	During the antifascist national liberation war, the Albanian people fought against Italy and Germany, which occupied the country.
en-000008130	In the 1939–1941 period, the antifascist resistance was led by the National Front nationalist groups and later by the Communist Party.
en-000008131	The party at first had little mass appeal, and even its youth organization netted few recruits.
en-000008132	This propaganda increased the number of new recruits by many young peoples eager for freedom.
en-000008133	Partisan leaders, on the contrary, counted on using the lust for revenge such reprisals would elicit to win recruits.
en-000008134	The Front included nationalist groups, but it was dominated by communist partisans.
en-000008135	A nationalist resistance to the Italian occupiers emerged in November 1942.
en-000008136	Ali Këlcyra and Midhat Frashëri formed the Western-oriented Balli Kombëtar (National Front).
en-000008137	Balli Kombetar was a movement that recruited supporters from both the large landowners and peasantry.
en-000008138	The communist partisans regrouped and gained control of southern Albania in January 1944.
en-000008139	Hoxha became the chairman of the council's executive committee and the National Liberation Army's supreme commander.
en-000008140	A provisional government the communists had formed at Berat in October administered Albania with Enver Hoxha as prime minister.
en-000008141	By early 1945, the communists had liquidated, discredited, or driven into exile most of the country's interwar elite.
en-000008142	Official ballot tallies showed that 92% of the electorate voted and that 93% of the voters chose the Democratic Front ticket.
en-000008143	The assembly convened in January 1946, annulled the monarchy, and transformed Albania into a "people's republic."
en-000008144	Enver Hoxha and Mehmet Shehu emerged as communist leaders in Albania, and are recognized by most western nations.
en-000008145	Political executions were common with between 5,000 and 25,000 killed in total under the communist regime.
en-000008146	Albania became an ally of the Soviet Union, but this came to an end in 1956 over the advent of de-Stalinization.
en-000008147	A strong political alliance with China followed, leading to several billion dollars in aid, which was curtailed after 1974.
en-000008148	China cut off aid in 1978 when Albania attacked its policies after the death of Chinese leader Mao Zedong.
en-000008149	During the period of socialist construction of Albania, the country saw rapid economic growth.
en-000008150	Enver Hoxha, who ruled Albania for four decades, died on 11 April 1985.
en-000008151	Eventually the new regime of Ramiz Alia introduced some liberalisation, and granting the freedom to travel abroad in 1990.
en-000008152	The new government made efforts to improve ties with the outside world.
en-000008153	In January 1945, the two governments signed a treaty reincorporating Kosovo into Yugoslavia as an autonomous province.
en-000008154	Shortly thereafter, Yugoslavia became the first country to recognize Albania's provisional government.
en-000008155	Tito distrusted Hoxha and the other intellectuals in the Albanian party and, through Xoxe and his loyalists, attempted to unseat them.
en-000008156	In 1947, Yugoslavia's leaders engineered an all-out offensive against anti-Yugoslav Albanian communists, including Hoxha and Spiru.
en-000008157	Albania became dependent on Soviet aid and know-how after the break with Yugoslavia in 1948.
en-000008158	Tirana soon entered into trade agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and the Soviet Union.
en-000008159	What little strategic value Albania offered the Soviet Union, however, gradually shrank as nuclear arms technology developed.
en-000008160	Anxious to pay homage to Stalin, Albania's rulers implemented new elements of the Stalinist economic system.
en-000008161	The Soviet Union's subsequent movement toward rapprochement with the hated Yugoslavs rankled the two Albanian leaders.
en-000008162	Tirana soon came under pressure from Moscow to copy, at least formally, the new Soviet model for a collective leadership.
en-000008163	Hoxha and Shehu were also alarmed at the prospect that Moscow might prefer less dogmatic rulers in Albania.
en-000008164	Albania played a role in the Sino-Soviet split far outweighing either its size or its importance in the communist world.
en-000008165	The Soviet Union, central European countries, and China all offered Albania large amounts of aid.
en-000008166	Despite these gestures, Tirana was dissatisfied with Moscow's economic policy toward Albania.
en-000008167	Hoxha and Shehu continued their harangue against the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia at the APL's Fourth Party Congress in February 1961.
en-000008168	Moscow responded by canceling aid programs and lines of credit for Albania, but the Chinese again came to the rescue.
en-000008169	In response, Tirana began broadening its contacts with the outside world.
en-000008170	Student agitators combed the countryside, forcing Albanians to quit practicing their faith.
en-000008171	A special decree abrogated the charters by which the country's main religious communities had operated.
en-000008172	As Hoxha's health declined, the first secretary began planning for an orderly succession.
en-000008173	In December 1976, Albania adopted its second Stalinist constitution of the postwar era.
en-000008174	Mikhail Gorbachev had appeared in the Soviet Union with new rules and policies (glasnost and perestroika).
en-000008175	Alia took similar steps, signing the Helsinki Agreement and allowing pluralism under pressure from students and workers.
en-000008176	Under Alia's regime, the first pluralist elections took place since the communists assumed power in Albania.
en-000008177	Nevertheless, it was clear that the change would not be stopped.
en-000008178	A committee of "national salvation" took over but also collapsed in half a year.
en-000008179	On 22 March 1992 the Communists were trumped by the Democratic Party in national elections.
en-000008180	The change from the Stalinist socialist state to a pluralist parliamentary system had many challenges.
en-000008181	In the general elections of June 1996 the Democratic Party tried to win an absolute majority and manipulated the results.
en-000008182	Since 1992 Albania has been seeking a closer relationship with the West.
en-000008183	In 1995, Albania had been accepted into the Council of Europe and requested membership in NATO.
en-000008184	The workforce of Albania has continued to emigrate to Western countries, especially Greece and Italy.
en-000008185	That summer, Berisha was defeated in elections, winning just 25 seats out of a total of 156.
en-000008186	In the 1997 unrest in Albania the general elections of June 1997 brought the Socialists and their allies to power.
en-000008187	President Berisha resigned from his post, and Socialists elected Rexhep Meidani as president of Albania.
en-000008188	Albanians approved its constitution through a popular referendum which was held in November 1998, but which was boycotted by the opposition.
en-000008189	Only if the new draft constitution is upheld in a popular referendum on December 15 will these provisions be annulled.
en-000008190	In June 2005, the democratic coalition formed a government with Prime Minister Sali Berisha.
en-000008191	His return to power in the elections of 3 July 2005 ended eight years of Socialist Party rule.
en-000008192	After Alfred Moisiu, in 2006 Bamir Topi was elected President of Albania until 2010.
en-000008193	Despite the political situation, the economy of Albania grew at an estimated 5% in 2007.
en-000008194	The Albanian lek has strengthened from 143 lekë to the US dollar in 2000 to 92 lekë in 2007.
en-000008195	In 2009 Albania – along with Croatia – officially joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
en-000008196	The land area that now makes up Finland was settled immediately after the last ice age, which ended in 9000 BC.
en-000008197	Finnish nationalism emerged, focused on Finnish cultural traditions, including music and—especially—the highly distinctive language and lyrics associated with it.
en-000008198	The catastrophic Finnish famine of 1866–1868 was followed by eased economic regulations and extensive emigration.
en-000008199	After the internal affairs stabilized, the still mainly agrarian economy grew relatively quickly.
en-000008200	Relations with the West, especially Sweden and Britain, were strong but tensions remained with the Soviet Union.
en-000008201	In the latter half of its independent history, Finland has maintained a mixed economy.
en-000008202	Since its post-World War II economic boom in the 1970s, Finland's GDP per capita has been among the world's highest.
en-000008203	In 1992, Finland simultaneously faced economic overheating and depressed Western, Russian, and local markets.
en-000008204	Finland joined the European Union in 1995, and replaced the Finnish markka with the euro in 2002.
en-000008205	According to a 2005 poll, most Finns at that point were reluctant to join NATO.
en-000008206	If confirmed, the oldest archeological site in Finland would be the Wolf Cave in Kristinestad, in Ostrobothnia.
en-000008207	The last ice age in the area of the modern-day Finland ended c. 9000 BC.
en-000008208	Finland has been continuously inhabited at least since the end of the last ice age, up to the present.
en-000008209	The earliest post-glacial inhabitants of the present-day area of Finland were probably mainly seasonal hunter-gatherers.
en-000008210	Their artifacts discovered are known to represent the Suomusjärvi and the Kunda cultures.
en-000008211	Among finds is the net of Antrea, the oldest fishing net known ever to have been excavated (calibrated carbon dating: ca.
en-000008212	The earliest samples belong to the Comb Ceramic Cultures, known for their distinctive decorating patterns.
en-000008213	This marks the beginning of the neolithic period for Finland, although subsistence was still based on hunting and fishing.
en-000008214	Extensive networks of exchange existed across Finland and northeastern Europe during the 5th millennium BC.
en-000008215	Rock paintings— apparently related to shamanistic and totemistic belief systems— have been found, especially in Eastern Finland, e.g.
en-000008216	Further inland, the societies retained their hunting-gathering lifestyles for the time being.
en-000008217	As the Finnish Iron Age lasted almost two millennia, it is further divided into six sub periods:
en-000008218	for which the findings of Pernaja and Savukoski provide solid argument.
en-000008219	Many of the era's dwelling sites are the same as those of the Neolithic.
en-000008220	Most of the iron of the era was produced on site.
en-000008221	During this period the (proto) Finnish culture stabilized on the coastal regions and larger graveyards become commonplace.
en-000008222	However most iron as well as its forging was of domestic origin, probably from bog iron.
en-000008223	The very first Christian burials are from the latter part of this era as well.
en-000008224	The Leväluhta burial findings suggest that the average height of a man was 158 cm and that of a woman was 147 cm.
en-000008225	The earliest findings of imported iron blades and local iron working appear in 500 BC.
en-000008226	From about 50 AD, there are indications of a more intense long-distance exchange of goods in coastal Finland.
en-000008227	Hillforts spread over most of southern Finland at the end of the Iron and early Medieval Age.
en-000008228	Cultural influences from a variety of places are visible in the Finnish archaeological finds from the very first settlements onwards.
en-000008229	For example, archaeological finds from Finnish Lapland suggest the presence of the Komsa culture from Norway.
en-000008230	An Old Norse-speaking population settled parts of Finland's coastal areas in the 12th to 13th centuries.
en-000008231	The Swedish language differentiated from the eastern Norse dialects by the 13th century.
en-000008232	During the subsequent Swedish reign over Finland particularly the coastal areas witnessed waves of settlement from Sweden.
en-000008233	There is possible evidence of Viking settlement in the Finnish mainland.
en-000008234	The Åland Islands probably had Swedish settlement during the Viking Period.
en-000008235	However, some scholars claim that the archipelago was deserted during the 11th century.
en-000008236	According to the archaeological finds, Christianity gained a foothold in Finland during the 11th century.
en-000008237	Later medieval legends describe Swedish attempts to conquer and Christianize Finland sometime in the mid-1150s.
en-000008238	In the early 13th century, Bishop Thomas became the first bishop of Finland.
en-000008239	There were several secular powers who aimed to bring the Finns under their rule.
en-000008240	These were Sweden, Denmark, the Republic of Novgorod in northwestern Russia, and probably the German crusading orders as well.
en-000008241	Finns had their own chiefs, but most probably no central authority.
en-000008242	The name "Finland" originally signified only the southwestern province that has been known as "Finland Proper" since the 18th century.
en-000008243	The concept of a Finnish "country" in the modern sense developed slowly from the 15th to 18th centuries.
en-000008244	Novgorod gained control in Karelia, the region inhabited by speakers of Eastern Finnish dialects.
en-000008245	Sweden however gained the control of Western Karelia with the Third Finnish Crusade in 1293.
en-000008246	During the 13th century, Finland was integrated into medieval European civilization.
en-000008247	The Dominican order arrived in Finland around 1249 and came to exercise huge influence there.
en-000008248	In the early 14th century, the first documents of Finnish students at Sorbonne appear.
en-000008249	In the southwestern part of the country, an urban settlement evolved in Turku.
en-000008250	Turku was one of the biggest towns in the Kingdom of Sweden, and its population included German merchants and craftsmen.
en-000008251	Otherwise the degree of urbanization was very low in medieval Finland.
en-000008252	Southern Finland and the long coastal zone of the Bothnian Gulf had a sparse farming settlements, organized as parishes and castellanies.
en-000008253	In the other parts of the country a small population of Sami hunters, fishermen and small-scale farmers lived.
en-000008254	In these regions, the Swedish language is widely spoken even today.
en-000008255	Swedish came to be the language of the upper class in many other parts of Finland as well.
en-000008256	The cathedral of Turku was the center of the cult of Saint Henry, and naturally the cultural center of the bishopric.
en-000008257	The bishop had the ecclesiastical authority over much of today's Finland and was usually the most powerful man there.
en-000008258	Bishops were often Finns, whereas the commanders in the castles were more often Scandinavian or German noblemen.
en-000008259	In 1362, representatives from Finland were called to participate in the elections for the king of Sweden.
en-000008260	As such, that year is often considered when Finland was incorporated into the Kingdom of Sweden.
en-000008261	The strong fortress of Viborg (Finnish: "Viipuri", Russian: "Vyborg") guarded the eastern border of Finland.
en-000008262	Sweden and Novgorod signed the Treaty of Nöteborg ("Pähkinäsaari" in Finnish) in 1323, but that would not last long.
en-000008263	During the 1380s, a civil war in the Scandinavian part of Sweden brought unrest to Finland as well.
en-000008264	The next 130 years or so were characterized by attempts of different Swedish factions to break out of the Union.
en-000008265	Towards the end of the 15th century, however, the situation on the eastern border became more tense.
en-000008266	The fortress-town of Viborg stood against a Russian siege; according to a contemporary legend, it was saved by a miracle.
en-000008267	In 1521 the Kalmar Union collapsed and Gustav Vasa became the King of Sweden.
en-000008268	King Gustav Vasa died in 1560 and his crown was passed to his three sons in separate turns.
en-000008269	This action contributed to the early stages of the Livonian War which was a warlike era which lasted for 160 years.
en-000008270	In the first phase, Sweden fought for the lordship of Estonia and Latvia against Denmark, Poland and Russia.
en-000008271	The common people of Finland suffered because of drafts, high taxes, and abuse by military personnel.
en-000008272	This resulted in the Cudgel War of 1596–1597, a desperate peasant rebellion, which was suppressed brutally and bloodily.
en-000008273	An important part of the 16th century history of Finland was growth of the area settled by the farming population.
en-000008274	The crown encouraged farmers from the province of Savonia to settle the vast wilderness regions in Middle Finland.
en-000008275	This was done, and the original Sami population often had to leave.
en-000008276	Some of the wilderness settled was traditional hunting and fishing territory of Karelian hunters.
en-000008277	The conquest of Livonia was now completed, and some territories were taken from internally divided Russia in the Treaty of Stolbova.
en-000008278	After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, the Swedish Empire was one of the most powerful countries in Europe.
en-000008279	During the war, several important reforms had been made in Finland:
en-000008280	In 1655–1660, the Northern Wars were fought, taking Finnish soldiers to the battle-fields of Livonia, Poland and Denmark.
en-000008281	In 1676, the political system of Sweden was transformed into an absolute monarchy.
en-000008282	In Middle and Eastern Finland, great amounts of tar were produced for export.
en-000008283	European nations needed this material for the maintenance of their fleets.
en-000008284	The Empire had a colony in the New World in the modern-day Delaware-Pennsylvania area between 1638–1655.
en-000008285	The 17th century was an era of very strict Lutheran orthodoxy.
en-000008286	In 1608, the law of Moses was declared the law of the land, in addition to secular legislation.
en-000008287	Every subject of the realm was required to confess the Lutheran faith and church attendance was mandatory.
en-000008288	On the other hand, the Lutheran requirement of the individual study of Bible prompted the first attempts at wide-scale education.
en-000008289	The church required from each person a degree of literacy sufficient to read the basic texts of the Lutheran faith.
en-000008290	Soon afterwards, another war determining Finland's fate began (the Great Northern War of 1700–21).
en-000008291	The Great Northern War (1700–1721) was devastating, as Sweden and Russia fought for control of the Baltic.
en-000008292	Harsh conditions—worsening poverty and repeated crop failures—among peasants undermined support for the war, leading to Sweden's defeat.
en-000008293	Russia was the winner, annexing the south-eastern part, including the town of Viborg, after the Treaty of Nystad.
en-000008294	The border with Russia came to lie roughly where it returned to after World War II.
en-000008295	Sweden's status as a European great power was forfeit, and Russia was now the leading power in the North.
en-000008296	parliamentarians with close connections to the royal court, with little to no influence.
en-000008297	Finland by this time was depopulated, with a population in 1749 of 427,000.
en-000008298	However, with peace the population grew rapidly, and doubled before 1800.
en-000008299	90% of the population were typically classified as "peasants", most being free taxed yeomen.
en-000008300	Society was divided into four Estates: peasants (free taxed yeomen), the clergy, nobility and burghers.
en-000008301	A minority, mostly cottagers, were estateless, and had no political representation.
en-000008302	The mid-18th century was a relatively good time, partly because life was now more peaceful.
en-000008303	Life in peaceful times can be dull, and British glory seems a long way in the past.
en-000008304	Instead the result of the Treaty of Åbo was that the Russian border was moved further to the west.
en-000008305	During this time, Russian propaganda hinted at the possibility of creating a separate Finnish kingdom.
en-000008306	Both the ascending Russian Empire and pre-revolutionary France aspired to have Sweden as a client state.
en-000008307	Parliamentarians and others with influence were susceptible to taking bribes which they did their best to increase.
en-000008308	Despite a couple of victorious battles, the war was fruitless, managing only to bring disturbance to the economic life of Finland.
en-000008309	During the war, a group of officers made the famous Anjala declaration demanding peace negotiations and calling of "Riksdag" (Parliament).
en-000008310	In 1789, the new constitution of Sweden strengthened the royal power further, as well as improving the status of the peasantry.
en-000008311	However, the continuing war had to be finished without conquests—and many Swedes now considered the king as a tyrant.
en-000008312	New things were changing even everyday life, such as starting of potato farming after the 1750s.
en-000008313	Trade increased and the peasantry was growing more affluent and self-conscious.
en-000008314	The two Russian occupations had been harsh and were not easily forgotten.
en-000008315	King Gustav III was assassinated in 1792, and his son Gustav IV Adolf assumed the crown after a period of regency.
en-000008316	There were even cases where the noblemen punished peasants corporally, for example by flogging.
en-000008317	The construction of military installations in the area brought thousands of non-Finnish people to the region.
en-000008318	The socken (local parish) was at once a community religious organization and a judicial district that administered the king's law.
en-000008319	The ting participated in the taxation process; taxes were collected by the bailiff, a royal appointee.
en-000008320	In Finland (and Sweden) the peasants formed one of the four estates and were represented in the parliament.
en-000008321	Outside the political sphere, however, the peasants were considered at the bottom of the social order—just above vagabonds.
en-000008322	After 1800 growing population pressure resulted in larger numbers of poor crofters and landless laborers and the impoverishment of small farmers.
en-000008323	During the Finnish War between Sweden and Russia, Finland was again conquered by the armies of Tsar Alexander I.
en-000008324	Russia assigned Karelia ("Old Finland") to the Grand Duchy in 1812.
en-000008325	During the years of Russian rule the degree of autonomy varied.
en-000008326	The old four-chamber Diet was re-activated in the 1860s agreeing to supplementary new legislation concerning internal affairs.
en-000008327	Before 1860 overseas merchant firms and the owners of landed estates had accumulated wealth that became available for industrial investments.
en-000008328	After 1860 the government liberalized economic laws and began to build a suitable physical infrastructure of ports, railroads and telegraph lines.
en-000008329	Alfred Kihlman (1825–1904) began as a Lutheran priest and director of the elite Helsingfors boys'school, the Swedish Normal Lyceum.
en-000008330	There was little precedent in Finland in the 1850s for raising venture capital.
en-000008331	Kihlman was well connected and enlisted businessmen and capitalists to invest in new enterprises.
en-000008332	However, Russification opened up a large Russian market especially for machinery.
en-000008333	Swedish was the language of administration, public institutions, education and cultural life.
en-000008334	In 1863, the Finnish language gained an official position in administration.
en-000008335	In 1892 Finnish finally became an equal official language and gained a status comparable to that of Swedish.
en-000008336	Nevertheless, the Swedish language continued to be the language of culture, arts and business all the way to the 1920s.
en-000008337	Movements toward Finnish national pride, as well as liberalism in politics and economics involved ethnic and class dimensions.
en-000008338	The nationalist movement against Russia began with the Fennoman movement led by Hegelian philosopher Johan Vilhelm Snellman in the 1830s.
en-000008339	The leading liberals were Swedish-speaking intellectuals who called for more democracy; they became the radical leaders after 1880.
en-000008340	The liberals organized for social democracy, labor unions, farmer cooperatives, and women's rights.
en-000008341	Nationalism was contested by the pro-Russian element and by the internationalism of the labor movement.
en-000008342	On the one hand was the high-church emphasis on ritual, with its roots in traditional peasant collective society.
en-000008343	Finland's political and Lutheran leaders considered both Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism to be threats to the emerging nation.
en-000008344	Orthodoxy was rejected as a weapon of Russification, while anti-Catholicism was long-standing.
en-000008345	Anti-Semitism was also a factor, so the Dissenter Law of 1889 upgraded the status only of the minor Protestant sects.
en-000008346	Before 1790 music was found in Lutheran churches and in folk traditions.
en-000008347	In 1790 music lovers founded the Åbo Musical Society; it gave the first major stimulus to serious music by Finnish composers.
en-000008348	By far the most influential composer was Jean Sibelius (1865–1957); he composed nearly all his music before 1930.
en-000008349	In April 1892 Sibelius presented his new symphony'Kullervo'in Helsinki.
en-000008350	It featured poetry from the "Kalevala," and was celebrated by critics as truly Finnish music.
en-000008351	Upper and upper middle class women took the lead in the deaconess movement in Finland.
en-000008352	Their efforts helped redefine the complex relationship between private charities and the traditional state and church responsibility for social welfare.
en-000008353	Finns were strongly opposed and fought back by passive resistance and a strengthening of Finnish cultural identity.
en-000008354	Thus, rich people could cast a number of votes, while the poor perhaps none at all.
en-000008355	The municipal voting system was changed to universal suffrage in 1917
en-000008356	In the 21st century about 700,000 Americans and 110,000 Canadians claim Finnish ancestry.
en-000008357	By 2000 about 6% of the population spoke Swedish as their first language, or 300,000 people.
en-000008358	However, since the late 20th century there has been a steady migration of older, better educated Swedish speakers to Sweden.
en-000008359	The new Senate was willing to cooperate with the Provisional government of Russia, but no agreement was reached.
en-000008360	The minority of the Parliament, and of the Senate, were content.
en-000008361	They didn't accept the Provisional government's right to dissolve the Parliament.
en-000008362	The disagreement over the Power Act led to the Social Democrats leaving the Senate.
en-000008363	When the Parliament met again after the summer recess in August 1917, only the groups supporting the Power Act were present.
en-000008364	Russian troops took possession of the chamber, the Parliament was dissolved, and new elections were held.
en-000008365	The result was a (small) non-Socialist majority and a purely non-Socialist Senate.
en-000008366	On the same day the Finnish Parliament issued a declaration by which it temporarily took power in Finland.
en-000008367	The Socialist-Communist Reds comprised the Finnish-speaking urban workers and the landless rural cottagers.
en-000008368	From January to May 1918, Finland experienced the brief but bitter Finnish Civil War.
en-000008369	On one side there were the "white" civil guards, who fought for the anti-Socialists.
en-000008370	On the other side were the Red Guards, which consisted of workers and tenant farmers.
en-000008371	The Reds lost the war and the White peasantry rose to political leadership in the 1920s–1930s.
en-000008372	About 37,000 men died, most of them in prisoner camps ravaged by influenza and other diseases.
en-000008373	The new republic faced a dispute over the Åland Islands, which were overwhelmingly Swedish-speaking and sought retrocession to Sweden.
en-000008374	However, as Finland was not willing to cede the islands, they were offered an autonomous status.
en-000008375	Nevertheless, the residents did not approve the offer, and the dispute over the islands was submitted to the League of Nations.
en-000008376	The League decided that Finland should retain sovereignty over the Åland Islands, but they should be made an autonomous province.
en-000008377	Alcohol abuse had a long history, especially regarding binge drinking and public intoxication, which became a crime in 1733.
en-000008378	In the 19th century the punishments became stiffer and stiffer, but the problem persisted.
en-000008379	Criminal convictions for drunkenness went up by 500%, and violence and crime rates soared.
en-000008380	Public opinion turned against the law, and a national plebiscite went 70% for repeal, so prohibition was ended in early 1932.
en-000008381	Nationalist sentiment remaining from the Civil War developed into the proto-Fascist Lapua Movement in 1929.
en-000008382	Finland was not occupied; its army of over 600,000 soldiers, saw only 3,500 prisoners-of-war.
en-000008383	About 96,000 Finns lost their lives, or 2.5% of a population of 3.8 million; civilian casualties were under 2,500.
en-000008384	The Baltic states accepted Soviet demands, and lost their independence in the summer of 1940.
en-000008385	This caused the Soviet Union to start a military invasion against Finland on 30 November 1939.
en-000008386	Soviet leaders predicted that Finland would be conquered in a couple of weeks.
en-000008387	The Winter War ended on 13 March 1940 with the Moscow peace treaty.

en-000008389	Finland received lots of international goodwill and material help from many countries during the war.
en-000008390	After the Winter War the Finnish army was exhausted, and needed recovery and support as soon as possible.
en-000008391	Finland accepted, weapon deals were made and military co-operation began in December 1940.

en-000008396	Most of the children were sent back by 1948, but 15–20% remained abroad.
en-000008397	The armistice compelled Finland to drive German troops from its territory, leading to the Lapland War 1944–1945.
en-000008398	In 1947, Finland reluctantly declined Marshall aid in order to preserve good relations with the Soviets, ensuring Finnish autonomy.
en-000008399	Nevertheless, the United States shipped secret development aid and financial aid to the non-communist SDP (Social Democratic Party).
en-000008400	After the reparations had been paid off, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union in the framework of bilateral trade.
en-000008401	Finland's role in the Second World War was in many ways strange.
en-000008402	However, even with massive superiority in military strength, the Soviet Union was unable to conquer Finland.
en-000008403	In late 1940, German-Finnish co-operation began; it took a form that was unique when compared to relations with the Axis.
en-000008404	Finland signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which made Finland an ally with Germany in the war against the Soviet Union.
en-000008405	Although Finland lost two wars with the Soviets, the memory of the war was sharply inscribed in the national consciousness.
en-000008406	It is celebrated as a victory for the national spirit by surviving against such long odds.
en-000008407	The losses of civilian people during the Partisan War were silent during the wars and long after wars.

en-000008412	That same year Finland joined the United Nations, though it had already been associated with a number of UN specialized organisations.
en-000008413	In 1972 Max Jakobson was a candidate for Secretary-General of the UN.
en-000008414	Finland became an associate member of the European Free Trade Association in 1961 and a full member in 1986.
en-000008415	A trade agreement with the EEC was complemented by another with the Soviet Bloc.
en-000008416	Officially claiming to be neutral, Finland lay in the grey zone between the Western countries and the Soviet Union.
en-000008417	The "YYA Treaty" (Finno-Soviet Pact of "Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance") gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics.
en-000008418	However, Finland maintained capitalism unlike most other countries bordering the Soviet Union.
en-000008419	While nationalization committees were set up in France and UK, Finland avoided nationalizations.

en-000008431	The post-war period was a time of rapid economic growth and increasing social and political stability for Finland.
en-000008432	The growth in the 1980s was based on debt and defaults started rolling in.
en-000008433	GDP declined by 15% and unemployment increased from a virtual full employment to one fifth of the workforce.
en-000008434	The crisis was amplified by trade unions'initial opposition to any reforms.
en-000008435	Some 7–8% of GDP was needed to bail out failing banks and force banking sector consolidation.
en-000008436	The accession process was marked by heavy public debate, where the differences of opinion did not follow party lines.
en-000008437	The process of accession was completed on January 1, 1995, when Finland joined the European Union along with Austria and Sweden.
en-000008438	Leading Finland into the EU is held as the main achievement of the Centrist-Conservative government of Esko Aho then in power.
en-000008439	In the economic policy, the EU membership brought with it many large changes.
en-000008440	During Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen's two successive governments 1995–2003, several large state companies were privatized fully or partially.

en-000008453	This allowed Germany the military advantage of controlling and expanding the railways there.
en-000008454	In August 1914 Imperial Germany violated Luxembourg's neutrality by invading it in its war against France.
en-000008455	This allowed Germany to use the railway lines, while at the same time denying them to France.

en-000008778	According to the Constitution, Vietnam is "in the period of transition to socialism".

en-000009209	In the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Prussia had annexed numerous territories and formed the North German Confederation.
en-000009210	This new power destabilized the European balance of power established by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars.
en-000009211	France was strongly opposed to any further alliance of German states, which would have significantly strengthened the Prussian military.
en-000009212	They also argue that he wanted a war to resolve growing domestic political problems.

en-000009214	The Ems telegram had exactly the effect on French public opinion that Bismarck had intended.

en-000009216	Gramont, the French foreign minister, declared that he felt "he had just received a slap".
en-000009217	A crowd of 15–20,000 people, carrying flags and patriotic banners, marched through the streets of Paris, demanding war.
en-000009218	On 19 July 1870 a declaration of war was sent to the Prussian government.
en-000009219	However, the Franco-Prussian War broke out before these reforms could be completely implemented.
en-000009220	The mitrailleuse was mounted on an artillery gun carriage and grouped in batteries in a similar fashion to cannon.
en-000009221	The only campaign plan prepared between 1866 and 1870 was a defensive one.
en-000009222	The Prussian army was controlled by the General Staff, under Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke.
en-000009223	Moltke embraced new technology, particularly the railroad and telegraph, to coordinate and accelerate mobilisation of large forces.
en-000009224	Unfortunately for Frossard's plan, the Prussian army was mobilizing far more rapidly than expected.
en-000009225	This did not materialize as the South German states had come to Prussia's aid and were mobilizing their armies against France.
en-000009226	Accordingly, on 31 July the Army marched forward toward the Saar River to seize Saarbrücken.
en-000009227	However the Prussians resisted strongly, and the French suffered 86 casualties to the Prussian 83 casualties.
en-000009228	Saarbrücken also proved to be a major obstacle in terms of logistics.
en-000009229	General Frossard, without instructions, hastily withdrew the elements of the Army of the Rhine in Saarbrücken back to Spicheren and Forbach.
en-000009230	What made a bad situation much worse was the conduct of General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot, commander of the 1st Division.
en-000009231	The first action of the Franco-Prussian War took place on 4 August 1870.
en-000009232	The fighting within the town had become extremely intense, becoming a door to door battle of survival.
en-000009233	Despite a never-ending attack of Prussian infantry, the soldiers of the 2nd Division kept to their positions.
en-000009234	The people of the town of Wissembourg finally surrendered to the Germans.
en-000009235	The Battle of Spicheren, on 5 August, was the second of three critical French defeats.
en-000009236	The aging General von Steinmetz made an overzealous, unplanned move, leading the 1st Army south from his position on the Moselle.
en-000009237	He moved straight toward the town of Spicheren, cutting off Prince Frederick Charles from his forward cavalry units in the process.
en-000009238	On the French side, planning after the disaster at Wissembourg had become essential.
en-000009239	General Le Bœuf, flushed with anger, was intent upon going on the offensive over the Saar and countering their loss.
en-000009240	Ignoring Moltke's plan again, both German armies attacked Frossard's French 2nd Corps, fortified between Spicheren and Forbach.
en-000009241	Treating the oncoming attacks as merely skirmishes, Frossard did not request additional support from other units.
en-000009242	By the time he realized what kind of a force he was opposing, it was too late.
en-000009243	Instead of continuing to defend the heights, by the close of battle after dusk he retreated to the south.
en-000009244	The German casualties were relatively high due to the advance and the effectiveness of the Chassepot rifle.
en-000009245	The French had been slowly reinforced and their force numbered only 35,000.
en-000009246	Although badly outnumbered, the French defended their position just outside Fröschwiller.
en-000009247	The Germans captured Fröschwiller which sat on a hilltop in the centre of the French line.
en-000009248	About 160,000 French soldiers were besieged in the fortress of Metz following the defeats on the frontier.
en-000009249	Despite odds of four to one, the III Corps launched a risky attack.
en-000009250	The French were routed and the III Corps captured Vionville, blocking any further escape attempts to the west.
en-000009251	The battle soon erupted, and III Corps was shattered by incessant cavalry charges, losing over half its soldiers.
en-000009252	On 16 August, the French had a chance to sweep away the key Prussian defense, and to escape.
en-000009253	Despite this misjudgment the two Prussian corps held the entire French army for the whole day.
en-000009254	Outnumbered 5 to 1, the extraordinary élan of the Prussians prevailed over gross indecision by the French.
en-000009255	The French had lost the opportunity to win a decisive victory.
en-000009256	Privat (18 August), was the largest battle during the Franco-Prussian War.
en-000009257	By 12:00, General Manstein opened up the battle before the village of Amanvillers with artillery from the 25th Infantry Division.
en-000009258	Finally aware of the Prussian advance, the French opened up a massive return fire against the mass of advancing Germans.
en-000009259	The battle at first appeared to favour the French with their superior Chassepot rifle.
en-000009260	However, the Prussian artillery was superior with the all-steel Krupp breech-loading gun.
en-000009261	At 15:00, the massed guns of the VII and VIII Corps opened fire to support the attack.
en-000009262	At 17:15, the Prussian 4th Guards Infantry Brigade joined the advance followed at 17:45 by the Prussian 1st Guards Infantry Brigade.
en-000009263	All of the Prussian Guard attacks were pinned down by lethal French gunfire from the rifle pits and trenches.
en-000009264	With the Prussians exhausted from the fighting, the French were now able to mount a counter-attack.
en-000009265	By 22:00, firing largely died down across the battlefield for the night.
en-000009266	A grand total of 20,163 German troops were killed, wounded or missing in action during the August 18 battle.
en-000009267	While most of the Prussians fell under the French Chassepot rifles, most French fell under the Prussian Krupp shells.
en-000009268	The Prussian Guards Infantry Divisions losses were even more staggering with 8,000 casualties out of 18,000 men.
en-000009269	The Special Guards Jäger lost 19 officers, a surgeon and 431 men out of a total of 700.
en-000009270	The 2nd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 39 officers and 1,076 men.
en-000009271	The 3rd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 36 officers and 1,060 men.
en-000009272	On the French side, the units holding St. Privat lost more than half their number in the village.
en-000009273	Napoleon III and MacMahon formed the new French Army of Châlons, to march on to Metz to rescue Bazaine.
en-000009274	Napoleon III personally led the army with Marshal MacMahon in attendance.
en-000009275	After a sharp fight in which they lost 5,000 men and 40 cannons, the French withdrew toward Sedan.
en-000009276	Having reformed in the town, the Army of Châlons was immediately isolated by the converging Prussian armies.
en-000009277	Napoleon III ordered the army to break out of the encirclement immediately.
en-000009278	With MacMahon wounded on the previous day, General Auguste Ducrot took command of the French troops in the field.
en-000009279	But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield.
en-000009280	Marguerite was killed leading the very first charge and the two additional charges led to nothing but heavy losses.
en-000009281	By the end of the day, with no hope of breaking out, Napoleon III called off the attacks.
en-000009282	The French lost over 17,000 men, killed or wounded, with 21,000 captured.
en-000009283	The Prussians reported their losses at 2,320 killed, 5,980 wounded and 700 captured or missing.
en-000009284	By the next day, on 2 September, Napoleon III surrendered and was taken prisoner with 104,000 of his soldiers.
en-000009285	The defeat of the French at Sedan had decided the war in Prussia's favour.
en-000009286	Bismarck wanted an early peace but had difficulty in finding a legitimate French authority with which to negotiate.
en-000009287	To allow supplies into Paris, one of the perimeter forts had to be handed over.
en-000009288	An impregnable military frontier was an inferior alternative to him, favoured only by the militant nationalists on the German side.
en-000009289	By September 15, German troops reached the outskirts of the fortified city.
en-000009290	On September 19, the Germans surrounded it and erected a blockade, as already established at Metz.
en-000009291	Today I say to you: rescue the French Republic by every means.
en-000009292	Prussian forces commenced the Siege of Paris on 19 September 1870.
en-000009293	Faced with the blockade, the new French government called for the establishment of several large armies in the French provinces.
en-000009294	Armed French civilians were to create a guerilla force—the so-called "Francs-tireurs"—for the purpose of attacking German supply lines.
en-000009295	These developments prompted calls from the German public for a bombardment of the city.
en-000009296	Von Blumenthal, who commanded the siege, was opposed to the bombardment on moral grounds.
en-000009297	In this he was backed by other senior military figures such as the Crown Prince and Moltke.
en-000009298	Rumors about an alleged German "extermination" plan infuriated the French and strengthened their support of the new regime.
en-000009299	Within a few weeks, five new armies totalling more than 500,000 troops were recruited.
en-000009300	The Germans were not prepared for an occupation of the whole of France.
en-000009301	On 10 October, hostilities began between German and French republican forces near Orléans.
en-000009302	After the surrender of Metz, more than 100,000 well-trained and experienced German troops joined the German'Southern Army'.
en-000009303	Following the Army of the Loire's defeats, Gambetta turned to General Faidherbe's Army of the North.
en-000009304	Despite access to the armaments factories of Lille, the Army of the North suffered from severe supply difficulties, which depressed morale.
en-000009305	In January 1871, Gambetta forced Faidherbe to march his army beyond the fortresses and engage the Prussians in open battle.
en-000009306	In the battle of the Lisaine, Bourbaki's men failed to break through German lines commanded by General August von Werder.
en-000009307	Bringing in the German'Southern Army', General von Manteuffel then drove Bourbaki's army into the mountains near the Swiss border.
en-000009308	On 28 January 1871 the Government of National Defence based in Paris negotiated an armistice with the Prussians.
en-000009309	Without the forts, the French Army would no longer be able to defend Paris.
en-000009310	At Tours, Gambetta received word from Paris on 30 January that the Government had surrendered.
en-000009311	Furious, he refused to surrender and launched an immediate attack on German forces at Orleans which, predictably, failed.
en-000009312	By the time engine repairs had been completed, the French fleet had already departed.
en-000009313	Only part of the 470-ship French Navy put to sea on 24 July.
en-000009314	The strategic advantages possessed by the Germans were not appreciated outside Germany until after hostilities had ceased.
en-000009315	The Prussian General Staff developed by Moltke proved to be extremely effective, in contrast to the traditional French school.
en-000009316	The structure also greatly strengthened Moltke's ability to control large formations spread out over significant distances.
en-000009317	This disorganization hampered the French commanders'ability to exercise control of their forces.
en-000009318	To the resulting lack of intelligence at the top can be ascribed all the inexcusable defects of French military policy.
en-000009319	Among these were two major reforms that substantially increased the military power of Germany.
en-000009320	The first was a reorganization of the army that integrated the regular army and the "Landwehr" reserves.
en-000009321	Each Prussian Corps was based within a "Kreis" (literally "circle") around the chief city in an area.
en-000009322	Reservists rarely lived more than a day's travel from their regiment's depot.
en-000009323	Reservists often faced several days'journey to report to their depots, and then another long journey to join their regiments.
en-000009324	Large numbers of reservists choked railway stations, vainly seeking rations and orders.
en-000009325	The effect of these differences was accentuated by the pre-war preparations.
en-000009326	In addition, the Prussian artillery batteries had 30% more guns than their French counterparts.
en-000009327	The Prussian batteries could thus destroy French artillery with impunity, before being moved forward to directly support infantry attacks.
en-000009328	The events of the Franco-Prussian War had great influence on military thinking over the next forty years.
en-000009329	This forced gunners to fire at longer range using indirect fire, usually from a position of cover.
en-000009330	An exodus occurred from Paris as some 200,000 people, predominantly middle-class, went to the countryside.
en-000009331	National guard units tried to seize power in Paris on 31 October 1870 and 22 January 1871.
en-000009332	The national government and regular army forces retreated to Versailles and a revolutionary government was proclaimed in Paris.
en-000009333	A commune was elected, which was dominated by socialists, anarchists and revolutionaries.
en-000009334	The survivors were amnestied by a bill introduced by Gambetta in 1880 and allowed to return.
en-000009335	Germany had established itself as a major power in continental Europe, boasting the most powerful and professional army in the world.
en-000009336	But when the major powers cooperate in a just cause, the world is a safer and saner place.
en-000009337	This was particularly manifested in the desire for another war with Germany in order to reclaim Alsace and Lorraine.
en-000009338	Paintings that emphasized the humiliation of the defeat became in high demand, such as those by Alphonse de Neuville.
en-000009339	7-Eleven is an international chain of convenience stores that operates, franchises, and licenses some 56,600 stores in 18 countries.
en-000009340	The chain was originally known as Tote'm Stores until renamed in 1946.
en-000009341	Its parent company, Seven-Eleven Japan Co., Ltd., is located in Chiyoda, Tokyo.
en-000009342	Seven-Eleven Japan is held by the Seven& I Holdings Co.
en-000009343	The company's first outlets were named "Tote'm Stores" because customers "toted" away their purchases.
en-000009344	Some stores featured genuine Alaskan totem poles in front of the store.
en-000009345	In November 1999, the corporate name of the US company was changed from "The Southland Corporation" to "7-Eleven Inc.".
en-000009346	He eventually bought the Southland Ice Company and turned it into Southland Corporation, which oversaw several locations in the Dallas area.
en-000009347	In 1928, Jenna Lira brought a totem pole as a souvenir from Alaska and placed it in front of the store.
en-000009348	The pole served as a marketing tool for the company, as it attracted a great deal of attention.
en-000009349	Soon, executives added totem poles in front of every store and eventually adopted an Inuit-inspired theme for their stores.
en-000009350	Later on, the stores began operating under the name "Tote'm Stores".
en-000009351	In the same year, the company began constructing gasoline stations in some of its Dallas locations as an experiment.
en-000009352	Southland also started to have a uniform for its ice station service boys.
en-000009353	This became the major factor in the company's success as a retail convenience store.
en-000009354	In 1931, the Great Depression affected the company, sending it toward bankruptcy.
en-000009355	This brought the company's ownership under the control of a board of directors.
en-000009356	Later on, 24-hour stores were established in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas, as well as Las Vegas, Nevada.
en-000009357	In 1971, Southland acquired convenience stores of the former Pak-A-Sak chain owned by Graham Allen Penniman, Sr. (1903–1985), of Shreveport, Louisiana.
en-000009358	With the purchase in 1964 of 126 Speedee Mart franchised convenience stores in California, the company entered the franchise business.
en-000009359	In December 1987, John Philp Thompson, the chairman and CEO of 7-Eleven, completed a $5.2 billion management buyout of the company.
en-000009360	This downsizing also resulted in numerous metropolitan areas losing 7-Eleven stores to rival convenience store operators.
en-000009361	Southland exited bankruptcy in March 1991, after a cash infusion of $430 million from Ito-Yokado and Seven-Eleven Japan.
en-000009362	These two Japanese entities now controlled 70% of the company, with the founding Thompson family retaining 5%.
en-000009363	In 1999, Southland Corp. changed its name to 7-Eleven, Inc., citing the divestment of operations other than 7-Eleven.
en-000009364	Ito-Yokado formed Seven& I Holdings Co. and 7-Eleven became its subsidiary in 2005.
en-000009365	3 spot in "Entrepreneur" Magazine's 31st Annual Franchise 500, "the first and most comprehensive ranking in the world".
en-000009366	This was the 17th year 7-Eleven was named in the top 10.
en-000009367	Also in 2010, the first "green" 7-Eleven store opened in DeLand, Florida.
en-000009368	The store features U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) elements.
en-000009369	Also, the environmentally-friendly design brings the store savings in energy costs.
en-000009370	It’s energy- and environmentally- friendly at a time when concerns about global warming are growing.
en-000009371	That same year, 7-Eleven went mobile with the launch of the iconic Slurpee drink's iPhone and Android Application (App).
en-000009372	The Slurpee drink app made it easy to find 7-Eleven stores and provides driving directions.
en-000009373	The following year, 7-Eleven celebrated its 40,000th store opening and within two years of that milestone opened its 50,000th store.
en-000009374	These beverage sizes were all among the largest commonly sold sodas when they were introduced.
en-000009375	7-Eleven has been commonly associated with these very large sodas in popular culture.
en-000009376	For example, Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposed ban on large sodas in New York City was commonly nicknamed the Big Gulp ban.
en-000009377	In China's 7-Eleven stores where Slurpees are offered, the Chinese name (sīlèbīng) is used.
en-000009378	Beverages, alcohol, candy, periodicals, and other convenience items are available as well.
en-000009379	The majority of these stores are open for 24 hours a day.
en-000009380	7-Eleven has operated in Hong Kong since 1981 under the ownership of Dairy Farm.
en-000009381	With most locations being in urbanized areas, approximately 40 percent are franchised stores.
en-000009382	Modern Sevel Indonesia's initial plans were to focus on opening stores in Jakarta, targeting densely populated commercial and business areas.
en-000009383	Other major cities, such as Bandung, Semarang, and Surabaya have been identified as expansion opportunities.
en-000009384	7-Eleven entered the Macau market in 2005 under the ownership of Dairy Farm, the same conglomeration group operating Hong Kong's 7-Eleven.
en-000009385	Bhd., which now operates 2,000 stores nationwide (as of July 2016).
en-000009386	7-Eleven in Malaysia was incorporated on June 4, 1984, by the Berjaya Group Berhad.
en-000009387	The first 7-Eleven store was opened in October 1984, in Jalan Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur.
en-000009388	It's popular in Sandakan and Kota Kinabalu because their prices are cheaper.
en-000009389	In Sandakan the Slurpee beverage is popular among teen and kids.
en-000009390	In the Philippines, 7-Eleven is run by the Philippine Seven Corporation (PSC).

en-000009446	The muskellunge is the largest member of the pike family, Esocidae.
en-000009447	Muskellunge closely resemble other esocids such as the northern pike and American pickerel in both appearance and behavior.
en-000009448	A fish with a weight of 61.25 lb (27.8 kg) was caught in November 2000 in Georgian Bay, Ontario.
en-000009449	In some cases, markings may be absent altogether, especially in fish from turbid waters.
en-000009450	This is in contrast to northern pike, which have dark bodies with light markings.
en-000009451	A reliable method to distinguish the two similar species is by counting the sensory pores on the underside of the mandible.
en-000009452	A muskie will have seven or more per side, while the northern pike never has more than six.
en-000009453	In addition, unlike pike, muskies have no scales on the lower half of their opercula.
en-000009454	Also, a small population is found in the Broad River in South Carolina.
en-000009455	Several North Georgia reservoirs also have healthy stocked populations of muskie.
en-000009456	They are also found in the Red River drainage of the Hudson Bay basin.
en-000009457	They prefer clear waters where they lurk along weed edges, rock outcrops, or other structures to rest.
en-000009458	A fish forms two distinct home ranges in summer: a shallow range and a deeper one.
en-000009459	The shallow range is generally much smaller than the deeper range due to shallow water heating up.
en-000009460	A muskie continually patrols the ranges in search of available food in the appropriate conditions of water temperature.
en-000009461	Muskies will attempt to take their prey head-first, sometimes in a single gulp.
en-000009462	They will take prey items up to 30% of their total length.
en-000009463	As muskellunge grow longer they increase in weight, but the relationship between length and weight is not linear.
en-000009464	The relationship between them can be expressed by a power-law equation:
en-000009465	The exponent b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c is a constant for each species.
en-000009466	For muskellunge, b = 3.325, higher than for many common species, and c = 0.000089 pounds/inch³.
en-000009467	They spawn in mid to late spring, somewhat later than northern pike, over shallow, vegetated areas.
en-000009468	A rock or sand bottom is preferred for spawning so the eggs do not sink into the mud and suffocate.

en-000009710	International law does not support the use of force by one state to annex the territory of another state.
en-000009711	International law has significant relations with territorial disputes because territorial disputes tackles the basis of international law; the state territory.

en-000009715	The Medes unified Iran as a nation and empire in 625 BC.
en-000009716	It was the largest empire yet seen and the first world empire.
en-000009717	Persia's arch-rival was the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire.
en-000009718	The Persian Empire proper begins in the Iron Age, following the influx of Iranian peoples.
en-000009719	Iranian people gave rise to the Medes, the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian Empires of classical antiquity.
en-000009720	Iran has continually reasserted its national identity throughout the centuries and has developed as a distinct political and cultural entity.
en-000009721	The Muslim conquest of Persia (633–656) ended the Sasanian Empire and was a turning point in Iranian history.
en-000009722	Many invasions of nomadic tribes, whose leaders became rulers in this country, affected it negatively.
en-000009723	In 1949, a Neanderthal radius was discovered by Carleton S. Coon in Bisitun Cave.
en-000009724	There are also 10,000-year-old human and animal figurines from Tepe Sarab in Kermanshah Province among many other ancient artifacts.
en-000009725	The two main Neolithic Iranian settlements were the Zayandeh River Culture and Ganj Dareh.
en-000009726	Parts of what is modern-day northwestern Iran was part of the Kura–Araxes culture (circa 3400 BC—ca.
en-000009727	2000 BC), that stretched up into the neighboring regions of the Caucasus and Anatolia.
en-000009728	Susa is one of the oldest-known settlements of Iran and the world.
en-000009729	The general perception among archeologists is that Susa was an extension of the Sumerian city state of Uruk.
en-000009730	In its later history, Susa became the capital of Elam, which emerged as a state found 4000 BC.
en-000009731	It is one of the most artifact-rich archaeological sites in the Middle East.
en-000009732	Archaeological excavations in Jiroft led to the discovery of several objects belonging to the 4th millennium BC.
en-000009733	There is a large quantity of objects decorated with highly distinctive engravings of animals, mythological figures, and architectural motifs.
en-000009734	The objects and their iconography are unlike anything ever seen before by archeologists.
en-000009735	Many are made from chlorite, a gray-green soft stone; others are in copper, bronze, terracotta, and even lapis lazuli.
en-000009736	Recent excavations at the sites have produced the world's earliest inscription which pre-dates Mesopotamian inscriptions.
en-000009737	Records become more tangible with the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its records of incursions from the Iranian plateau.
en-000009738	As early as the 20th century BC, tribes came to the Iranian Plateau from the Pontic–Caspian steppe.
en-000009739	Bahman Firuzmandi say that the southern Iranians might be intermixed with the Elamite peoples living in the plateau.
en-000009740	By the mid-first millennium BC, Medes, Persians, and Parthians populated the Iranian plateau.
en-000009741	Until the rise of the Medes, they all remained under Assyrian domination, like the rest of the Near East.
en-000009742	In the first half of the first millennium BC, parts of what is now Iranian Azerbaijan were incorporated into Urartu.
en-000009743	In 646 BC, The Assyrian king Ashurbanipal sacked Susa, which ended Elamite supremacy in the region.
en-000009744	For over 150 years Assyrian kings of nearby Northern Mesopotamia were seeking to conquer Median tribes of Western Iran.
en-000009745	Under pressure from Assyria, the small kingdoms of the western Iranian plateau coalesced into increasingly larger and more centralized states.
en-000009746	In the second half of the seventh century BC, the Medes gained their independence and were united by Deioces.
en-000009747	Urartu was later on conquered and dissolved as well by the Medes.
en-000009748	Cyrus the Great overthrew, in turn, the Median, Lydian, and Neo-Babylonian Empires, creating an empire far larger than Assyria.
en-000009749	The winner, Darius I, based his claim on membership in a collateral line of the Achaemenid Empire.
en-000009750	Darius'first capital was at Susa, and he started the building programme at Persepolis.

en-000009753	In 499 BC, Athens lent support to a revolt in Miletus which resulted in the sacking of Sardis.
en-000009754	In the First Persian invasion of Greece, the Persian general Mardonius resubjugated Thrace and made Macedon a full part of Persia.
en-000009755	Darius'successor Xerxes I launched the Second Persian invasion of Greece.
en-000009756	However, after a string of Greek victories the Persians were forced to withdraw thus losing control of Macedonia, Thrace and Ionia.
en-000009757	In 404 BC following the death of Darius II, Egypt rebelled under Amyrtaeus.
en-000009758	Later pharaohs successfully resisted Persian attempts to reconquer Egypt until 343 BC, when Egypt was reconquered by Artaxerxes III.
en-000009759	During the Seleucid era, Greek became the common tongue of diplomacy and literature throughout the empire
en-000009760	Parthia was the Eastern arch-enemy of the Roman Empire; and it limited Rome's expansion beyond Cappadocia (central Anatolia).
en-000009761	The Parthian armies included two types of cavalry: the heavily armed and armoured cataphracts and lightly-armed but highly-mobile mounted archers.
en-000009762	On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they were unskilled in siege warfare.
en-000009763	Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able completely to annex each other's territory.
en-000009764	The Parthian empire subsisted for five centuries, longer than most Eastern Empires.
en-000009765	The first shah of the Sasanian Empire, Ardashir I, started reforming the country both economically and militarily.
en-000009766	During Khosrow II's rule in 590–628, Egypt, Jordan, Palestine and Lebanon were also annexed to the Empire.
en-000009767	The Sassanians called their empire "Erânshahr" ("Dominion of the Aryans", i.e.
en-000009768	A chapter of Iran's history followed after roughly six hundred years of conflict with the Roman Empire.
en-000009769	Under Justinian I, the war came to an uneasy peace with payment of tribute to the Sassanians.
en-000009770	However the Sasanians used the deposition of the Byzantine emperor Maurice as a "casus belli" to attack the Empire.
en-000009771	After many gains, the Sassanians were defeated at Issus, Constantinople and finally Nineveh, resulting in peace.
en-000009772	The dynasty's unique and aristocratic culture transformed the Islamic conquest and destruction of Iran into a Persian Renaissance.
en-000009773	Yazdegerd III, fled from one district to another until a local miller killed him for his purse at Merv in 651.
en-000009774	By 674, Muslims had conquered Greater Khorasan (which included modern Iranian Khorasan province and modern Afghanistan and parts of Transoxiana).
en-000009775	The Muslim conquest of Persia ended the Sasanian Empire and led to the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia.
en-000009776	Most of the aspects of the previous Persian civilizations were not discarded, but were absorbed by the new Islamic polity.
en-000009777	During the Umayyad Caliphate, the Arab conquerors imposed Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire.
en-000009778	In al-Biruni's "From The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries" for example it is written:
en-000009779	Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues.
en-000009780	The half-hearted policies of the late Umayyads to tolerate non-Arab Muslims and Shias had failed to quell unrest among these minorities.
en-000009781	The Arabs had invaded these regions several times, but achieved no decisive result because of the inaccessible terrain of the regions.
en-000009782	With the death of the Umayyad Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 743, the Islamic world was launched into civil war.
en-000009783	Abu Muslim was sent to Khorasan by the Abbasid Caliphate initially as a propagandist and then to revolt on their behalf.
en-000009784	He took Merv defeating the Umayyad governor there Nasr ibn Sayyar.
en-000009785	During the same period, the Dabuyid ruler Khurshid declared independence from the Umayyads, but was shortly forced to recognize Abbasid authority.
en-000009786	In 750, Abu Muslim became leader of the Abbasid army and defeated the Umayyads at the Battle of the Zab.
en-000009787	Abu Muslim stormed Damascus, the capital of the Umayyad caliphate, later that year.
en-000009788	The Abbasid army consisted primarily of Khorasanians and was led by an Iranian general, Abu Muslim Khorasani.
en-000009789	It contained both Iranian and Arab elements, and the Abbasids enjoyed both Iranian and Arab support.
en-000009790	The city of Baghdad was constructed on the Tigris River, in 762, to serve as the new Abbasid capital.
en-000009791	The Abbasids established the position of vizier like Barmakids in their administration, which was the equivalent of a "vice-caliph", or second-in-command.
en-000009792	The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan.
en-000009793	By the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Persian faction known as the Buyid dynasty (934–1062).
en-000009794	Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian anyway, the Buyids were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad.
en-000009795	Islamization was a long process by which Islam was gradually adopted by the majority population of Iran.
en-000009796	Richard Bulliet's "conversion curve" indicates that only about 10% of Iran converted to Islam during the relatively Arab-centric Umayyad period.
en-000009797	Seyyed Hossein Nasr suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers.
en-000009798	Most of those behind the movement were Persian, but references to Egyptians, Berbers and Aramaeans are attested.
en-000009799	The most notable effect of the movement was the survival of the Persian language to the present day.
en-000009800	Their successor, the Ghaznawids, who were of non-Iranian Turkic origin, also became instrumental in the revival of Persian.
en-000009801	The culmination of the Persianization movement was the "Shahnameh", the national epic of Iran, written almost entirely in Persian.
en-000009802	This voluminous work, reflects Iran's ancient history, its unique cultural values, its pre-Islamic Zoroastrian religion, and its sense of nationhood.
en-000009803	Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance.
en-000009804	In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam.
en-000009805	The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna..."
en-000009806	The Ghaznavids are generally credited with launching Islam into a mainly Hindu India.
en-000009807	The invasion of India was undertaken in 1000 by the Ghaznavid ruler, Mahmud, and continued for several years.
en-000009808	They were unable to hold power for long, however, particularly after the death of Mahmud in 1030.
en-000009809	By 1040 the Seljuqs had taken over the Ghaznavid lands in Iran.
en-000009810	They established a Sunni Muslim rule over parts of Central Asia and the Middle East from the 11th to 14th centuries.
en-000009811	The dynastic founder, Tughril Beg, turned his army against the Ghaznavids in Khorasan.
en-000009812	He moved south and then west, conquering but not wasting the cities in his path.
en-000009813	In 1055 the caliph in Baghdad gave Tughril Beg robes, gifts, and the title King of the East.
en-000009814	The Khwarezmid Empire was a Sunni Muslim Persianate dynasty, of East Turkic origin, that ruled in Central Asia.
en-000009815	Originally vassals of the Seljuqs, they took advantage of the decline of the Seljuqs to expand into Iran.
en-000009816	Of the former Seljuq Empire, only the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia remained.
en-000009817	Several of the various theories on the etymology of the word "assassin" derive from these killers.
en-000009818	The Khwarezmid Empire only lasted for a few decades, until the arrival of the Mongols.
en-000009819	At that time, the Khwarezmid Empire was ruled by Ala ad-Din Muhammad (1200–1220).
en-000009820	Muhammad, like Genghis, was intent on expanding his lands and had gained the submission of most of Iran.
en-000009821	He declared himself shah and demanded formal recognition from the Abbasid caliph an-Nasir.
en-000009822	When the caliph rejected his claim, Ala ad-Din Muhammad proclaimed one of his nobles caliph and unsuccessfully tried to depose an-Nasir.
en-000009823	The Mongol invasion of Iran began in 1219, after two diplomatic missions to Khwarezm sent by Genghis Khan had been massacred.
en-000009824	During 1220–21 Bukhara, Samarkand, Herat, Tus and Nishapur were razed, and the whole populations were slaughtered.
en-000009825	The Khwarezm-Shah fled, to die on an island off the Caspian coast.
en-000009826	The Chinese may have used the catapults to hurl gunpowder bombs, since they already had them by this time.
en-000009827	While Genghis Khan was conquering Transoxania and Persia, several Chinese who were familiar with gunpowder were serving in Genghis's army.
en-000009828	Historians have suggested that the Mongol invasion had brought Chinese gunpowder weapons to Central Asia.
en-000009829	Books written around the area afterward depicted gunpowder weapons which resembled those of China.
en-000009830	Before his death in 1227, Genghis had reached western Azerbaijan, pillaging and burning cities along the way.
en-000009831	Genghis'grandson, Hulagu Khan, was tasked with the westward expansion of Mongol dominion.
en-000009832	However, by time he ascended to power, the Mongol Empire had already dissolved, dividing into different factions.
en-000009833	Hulagu Khan seized Baghdad in 1258 and put the last Abbasid caliph to death.
en-000009834	Hulagu's campaigns against the Muslims also enraged Berke, khan of the Golden Horde and a convert to Islam.
en-000009835	Hulagu and Berke fought against each other, demonstrating the weakening unity of the Mongol empire.
en-000009836	The rule of Hulagu's great-grandson, Ghazan Khan (1295–1304) saw the establishment of Islam as the state religion of the Ilkhanate.
en-000009837	Ghazan and his famous Iranian vizier, Rashid al-Din, brought Iran a partial and brief economic revival.
en-000009838	The Mongols lowered taxes for artisans, encouraged agriculture, rebuilt and extended irrigation works, and improved the safety of the trade routes.
en-000009839	Items from India, China, and Iran passed easily across the Asian steppes, and these contacts culturally enriched Iran.
en-000009840	The mid-14th-century Black Death killed about 30% of the country's population.
en-000009841	According to Mortaza Motahhari the majority of Iranian scholars and masses remained Sunni until the time of the Safavids.
en-000009842	The domination of Sunnis did not mean Shia were rootless in Iran.
en-000009843	The writers of The Four Books of Shia were Iranian, as well as many other great Shia scholars.
en-000009844	The domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterized the religious history of Iran during this period.
en-000009845	During this period, Shia in Iran were nourished from Kufah, Baghdad and later from Najaf and Hillah.
en-000009846	Shiism was the dominant sect in Tabaristan, Qom, Kashan, Avaj and Sabzevar.
en-000009847	In many other areas merged population of Shia and Sunni lived together.
en-000009848	During the 10th and 11th centuries, Fatimids sent Ismailis Da'i (missioners) to Iran as well as other Muslim lands.
en-000009849	When Ismailis divided into two sects, Nizaris established their base in Iran.
en-000009850	After the Mongol raid and fall of the Abbasids, Sunni hierarchies faltered.
en-000009851	Not only did they lose the caliphate but also the status of official madhhab.
en-000009852	Their loss was the gain of Shia, whose center wasn't in Iran at that time.
en-000009853	Several local Shia dynasties like Sarbadars were established during this time.
en-000009854	Like its predecessors, the Timurid Empire was also part of the Persianate world.
en-000009855	After establishing a power base in Transoxiana, Timur invaded Iran in 1381 and eventually conquered most of it.
en-000009856	Timur's campaigns were known for their brutality; many people were slaughtered and several cities were destroyed.
en-000009857	His regime was characterized by its inclusion of Iranians in administrative roles and its promotion of architecture and poetry.
en-000009858	Persia underwent a revival under the Safavid dynasty (1502–1736), the most prominent figure of which was Shah Abbas I.
en-000009859	Some historians credit the Safavid dynasty for founding the modern nation-state of Iran.
en-000009860	Iran's contemporary Shia character, and significant segments of Iran's current borders take their origin from this era ("e.g.
en-000009861	The Safavid ruling dynasty was founded by Ismāil, who styled himself Shāh Ismāil I.
en-000009862	This system of mass usage of Caucasian subjects remained to exist until the fall of the Qajar Dynasty.
en-000009863	The greatest of the Safavid monarchs, Shah Abbas I the Great (1587–1629) came to power in 1587 aged 16.
en-000009864	The end of Abbas II'reign in 1666, marked the beginning of the end of the Safavid dynasty.
en-000009865	Despite falling revenues and military threats, many of the later shahs had lavish lifestyles.
en-000009866	Shah Soltan Hosain (1694–1722) in particular was known for his love of wine and disinterest in governance.
en-000009867	Iran's territorial integrity was restored by a native Iranian Turkic Afshar warlord from Khorasan, Nader Shah.
en-000009868	By 1736, Nader had become so powerful he was able to depose the Safavids and have himself crowned shah.
en-000009869	On his way back, he also conquered all Uzbek khanates- except Kokand- and made the Uzbeks his vassals.
en-000009870	He also firmly reestablished Persian rule over the entire Caucasus, Bahrain, as well as large parts of Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
en-000009871	Frustratingly for him, the Dagestanis resorted to guerrilla warfare and Nader with his standard army could make little headway against them.
en-000009872	In his later years this eventually provoked multiple revolts and, ultimately, Nader's assassination in 1747.
en-000009873	Nader's death was followed by a period of anarchy in Iran as rival army commanders fought for power.
en-000009874	Nader's own family, the Afsharids, were soon reduced to holding on to a small domain in Khorasan.
en-000009875	Many of the Caucasian territories broke away in various Caucasian khanates.
en-000009876	Oman and the Uzbek khanates of Bukhara and Khiva regained independence.
en-000009877	Ahmad Shah Durrani, one of Nader's officers, founded an independent state which eventually became modern Afghanistan.
en-000009878	Agha Mohammad Khan emerged victorious out of the civil war that commenced with the death of the last Zand king.
en-000009879	His reign is noted for the reemergence of a centrally led and united Iran.
en-000009880	Therefore, his first objective after having secured mainland Iran, was to reincorpate the Caucasus region into Iran.
en-000009881	The Ottomans, Iran's neighboring rival, recognized the latters rights over Kartli and Kakheti for the first time in four centuries.
en-000009882	Reassessment of Iranian hegemony over Georgia did not last long; in 1799 the Russians marched into Tbilisi.
en-000009883	Following the official losing of the aforementioned vast territories in the Caucasus, major demographic shifts were bound to take place.
en-000009884	Solidly Persian-speaking territories of Iran were lost, with all its inhabitants in it.
en-000009885	Some of these groups included the Ayrums, Qarapapaqs, Circassians, Shia Lezgins, and other Transcaucasian Muslims.
en-000009886	Others simply voluntarily refused to live under Christian Russian rule, and thus disembarked for Turkey or Iran.
en-000009887	The initial ranks of the brigade would be entirely composed of Circassians and other Caucasian Muhajirs.
en-000009888	This brigade would prove decisive in the following decades to come in Qajar history.
en-000009889	This also helped in changing the demographics of the regions considerably.
en-000009890	The Treaty of Adrianople, concluded with Turkey in 1829 granted for more mass settling of Armenians in the newly incorporated territories.
en-000009891	Fath Ali Shah's reign saw increased diplomatic contacts with the West and the beginning of intense European diplomatic rivalries over Iran.
en-000009892	The Great Persian Famine of 1870–1871 is believed to have caused the death of 2 million persons.
en-000009893	The Shah managed to remain in power, granting a limited constitution in 1906 (making the country a constitutional monarchy).
en-000009894	During World War I, the country was occupied by British, Ottoman and Russian forces but was essentially neutral (see Persian Campaign).
en-000009895	In 1919, after the Russian revolution and their withdrawal, Britain attempted to establish a protectorate in Iran, which was unsuccessful.
en-000009896	Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabai was also a leader and important figure in the perpetration of the coup.
en-000009897	He established an authoritarian government that valued nationalism, militarism, secularism and anti-communism combined with strict censorship and state propaganda.
en-000009898	Reza Shah introduced many socio-economic reforms, reorganizing the army, government administration, and finances.
en-000009899	However, his attempts of modernisation have been criticised for being "too fast" and "superficial",
en-000009900	and his reign a time of "oppression, corruption, taxation, lack of authenticity" with "security typical of police states."
en-000009901	Many of the new laws and regulations created resentment among devout Muslims and the clergy.
en-000009902	Dozens were killed and hundreds were injured when troops finally quelled the unrest.
en-000009903	German interest largely control the Iranian economy in 1941, and had staged a failed coup to take over the government.
en-000009904	In response the Allies invaded in August 1941, and easily overwhelmed the weak Iranian army in "Operation Countenance".
en-000009905	Iran became the major conduit of Allied Land-Lease aid to the Soviet Union.
en-000009906	The purpose was to secure Iranian oil fields and ensure Allied supply lines (see "Persian Corridor").
en-000009907	Its monarch Rezā Shāh was deposed during the subsequent occupation and replaced with his young son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
en-000009908	At the Tehran Conference of 1943, the Allies issued the Tehran Declaration guaranteed the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran.

en-000009917	Iran was ruled as an autocracy under the shah with American support from that time until the revolution.
en-000009918	Modernization and economic growth proceeded at an unprecedented rate, fueled by Iran's vast petroleum reserves, the third-largest in the world.
en-000009919	Thus, the acceleration of economic growth since the third quarter of 2012 should come as no surprise.
en-000009920	Two years later, premier Hassan Ali Mansur was assassinated and the internal security service, SAVAK, became more violently active.

en-000009928	Following the Arab-Israeli War of October 1973, Iran did not join the Arab oil embargo against the West and Israel.

en-000009930	A border dispute between Iraq and Iran was resolved with the signing of the Algiers Accord on March 6, 1975.
en-000009931	Iran officially became an Islamic Republic on April 1, 1979, when Iranians overwhelmingly approved a national referendum to make it so.
en-000009932	The ideology of revolutionary government was populist, nationalist and most of all Shi'a Islamic.
en-000009933	Khomeini served as this ruling jurist, or supreme leader, until his death in 1989.

en-000009938	An early event in the history of the Islamic republic that had a long-term impact was the Iran hostage crisis.

en-000009941	Of chief importance to Iraq was Khuzestan which not only boasted a substantial Arab population, but rich oil fields as well.
en-000009942	On September 22, 1980, the Iraqi army invaded Iran at Khuzestan, precipitating the Iran–Iraq War.

en-000009952	He was beaten by an independent candidate from the reformist, Mohammad Khatami.
en-000009953	Mohammad Khatami's presidency was soon marked by tensions between the reform-minded government and an increasingly conservative and vocal clergy.
en-000009954	This rift reached a climax in July 1999 when massive anti-government protests erupted in the streets of Tehran.
en-000009955	The disturbances lasted over a week before police and pro-government vigilantes dispersed the crowds.
en-000009956	Khatami was re-elected in June 2001 but his efforts were repeatedly blocked by the conservatives in the parliament.

en-000009967	This alter ego group would give them the freedom to experiment musically.

en-000009979	Nanotechnology gives us increasing control over the material world, providing opportunities to enhance existing technologies and develop new ones.
en-000009980	He would from this point on provide the artistic direction for the group's releases.
en-000009981	Pepper ""grew naturally out of "Revolver"", marking "an era of almost continuous technological experimentation".
en-000009982	This approach afforded him the extra time required to write and record melodic basslines that complemented the song's final arrangement.
en-000009983	The engineer Ken Townsend devised a method for accomplishing this by using a 50 Hz control signal between the two machines.
en-000009984	The process soon became a common recording practice in popular music.

en-000009994	Womack characterises "Lovely Rita" as a work of "full-tilt psychedelia" that contrasts sharply with the preceding track.
en-000009995	The track utilises the bluesy mixolydian mode in A, which Everett credits with "perfectly express[ing] Lennon's grievance against complacency".
en-000009996	Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)" serves as a bookend for the album and a segue to its finale.
en-000009997	The hard-rocking song was written after the Beatles'assistant, Neil Aspinall, suggested that since"Sgt.
en-000009998	Pepper" opened the album, the fictional band should make an appearance near the end.
en-000009999	The idea to use an orchestra was McCartney's; he drew inspiration from the avant-garde composers John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen.
en-000010000	For "A Day in the Life", he wanted his voice to sound like Elvis Presley on "Heartbreak Hotel".

en-000010019	He characterises the LP as "playful but contrived" and "less a summing up of its era than a concession to it".
en-000010020	Rock and roll is not an'art form'; rock and roll is a raw wail from the bottom of the guts.
en-000010021	Pepper " in that respect, accusing the album of"mark[ing] a fall from primal grace into pretense, production and self-consciousness.
en-000010022	Pepper" is thought of as the most influential of all rock masterpieces, it is really only the most famous.
en-000010023	In retrospect it seems peculiarly apollonian– precise, controlled, even stiff– and it is clearly peripheral to the rock mainstream".

en-000010035	It has sold more than 32 million copies worldwide, making it one of the highest-selling albums of all time.
en-000010036	Pepper " was ranked first in Colin Larkin's"All Time Top 1000 Albums".
en-000010037	He described it as"the album that revolutionized, changed and re-invented the boundaries of modern popular music.
en-000010038	In 2006 it was chosen by "Time" as one of the 100 best albums of all time.

en-000010047	As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815.
en-000010048	One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide.
en-000010049	Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has ensured his status as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.
en-000010050	He was born in Corsica to a relatively modest family from the minor nobility.
en-000010051	When the Revolution broke out in 1789, Napoleon was serving as an artillery officer in the French army.
en-000010052	He attempted to capitalize quickly on the new political situation by returning to Corsica in hopes of starting a political career.
en-000010053	In 1798, he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power.
en-000010054	He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic.
en-000010055	His rising ambition inspired him to go further, and in 1804 he became the first "Emperor of the French".
en-000010056	Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a Third Coalition by 1805.
en-000010057	In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him because Prussia became worried about growing French influence on the continent.
en-000010058	The Peninsular War lasted six years, featured extensive guerrilla warfare, and ended in victory for the Allies.
en-000010059	The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states, especially Russia.
en-000010060	The French launched a major invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812.
en-000010061	In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France.
en-000010062	A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813.
en-000010063	The Allies then invaded France and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April.
en-000010064	He was exiled to the island of Elba near Rome and the Bourbons were restored to power.
en-000010065	However, Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again.
en-000010066	The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June.
en-000010067	He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe.
en-000010068	This was a year after the island was transferred to France by the Republic of Genoa.
en-000010069	His father "Nobile" Carlo Buonaparte was an attorney, and was named Corsica's representative to the court of Louis XVI in 1777.
en-000010070	The dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, Letizia Ramolino, whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child.
en-000010071	He had an elder brother, Joseph, and younger siblings: Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline, and Jérôme.
en-000010072	A boy and girl were born before Joseph but died in infancy.
en-000010073	Napoleon's noble, moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical Corsican of the time.
en-000010074	In January 1779, he was enrolled at a religious school in Autun.
en-000010075	In May, he was admitted to a military academy at Brienne-le-Château.
en-000010076	He was teased by other students for his accent and applied himself to reading.
en-000010077	An examiner observed that Napoleon"has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics.
en-000010078	On completion of his studies at Brienne in 1784, Napoleon was admitted to the elite "École Militaire" in Paris.
en-000010079	He was the first Corsican to graduate from the École Militaire.
en-000010080	Upon graduating in September 1785, Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in "La Fère" artillery regiment.
en-000010081	Thirty thousand Frenchmen were vomited on to our shores, drowning the throne of liberty in waves of blood.
en-000010082	Such was the odious sight which was the first to strike me."
en-000010083	Bonaparte and his family fled to the French mainland in June 1793 because of the split with Paoli.
en-000010084	The assault on the position led to the capture of the city, but during it Bonaparte was wounded in the thigh.
en-000010085	He was promoted to brigadier general at the age of 24.
en-000010086	He devised plans for attacking the Kingdom of Sardinia as part of France's campaign against the First Coalition.
en-000010087	Augustin Robespierre and Saliceti were ready to listen to the freshly promoted artillery general.
en-000010088	From Ormea, they headed west to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around Saorge.
en-000010089	Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defense in a letter to the commissar Salicetti, and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.
en-000010090	By 1795, Bonaparte had become engaged to Désirée Clary, daughter of François Clary.
en-000010091	On 3 October, royalists in Paris declared a rebellion against the National Convention.
en-000010092	He had cleared the streets with "a whiff of grapeshot", according to 19th-century historian Thomas Carlyle in "".
en-000010093	Murat married one of Napoleon's sisters and became his brother-in-law; he also served under Napoleon as one of his generals.
en-000010094	Bonaparte was promoted to Commander of the Interior and given command of the Army of Italy.
en-000010095	Within weeks, he was romantically attached to Joséphine de Beauharnais, the former mistress of Barras.
en-000010096	The couple married on 9 March 1796 in a civil ceremony.
en-000010097	Two days after the marriage, Bonaparte left Paris to take command of the Army of Italy.
en-000010098	He immediately went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the forces of Piedmont before their Austrian allies could intervene.
en-000010099	In a series of rapid victories during the Montenotte Campaign, he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks.
en-000010100	The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy.
en-000010101	At Rivoli, the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000.
en-000010102	The next phase of the campaign featured the French invasion of the Habsburg heartlands.
en-000010103	Bonaparte marched on Venice and forced its surrender, ending 1,100 years of independence.
en-000010104	He also authorized the French to loot treasures such as the Horses of Saint Mark.
en-000010105	In this Italian campaign, Bonaparte's army captured 150,000 prisoners, 540 cannons, and 170 standards.
en-000010106	The French army fought 67 actions and won 18 pitched battles through superior artillery technology and Bonaparte's tactics.
en-000010107	He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in France.
en-000010108	The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator.
en-000010109	This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria.
en-000010110	These negotiations resulted in the Treaty of Campo Formio, and Bonaparte returned to Paris in December as a hero.
en-000010111	He decided on a military expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India.
en-000010112	The Directory agreed in order to secure a trade route to India.
en-000010113	In May 1798, Bonaparte was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences.
en-000010114	His Egyptian expedition included a group of 167 scientists, with mathematicians, naturalists, chemists, and geodesists among them.
en-000010115	Their discoveries included the Rosetta Stone, and their work was published in the "Description de l'Égypte" in 1809.
en-000010116	En route to Egypt, Bonaparte reached Malta on 9 June 1798, then controlled by the Knights Hospitaller.
en-000010117	General Bonaparte and his expedition eluded pursuit by the Royal Navy and landed at Alexandria on 1 July.
en-000010118	He fought the Battle of Shubra Khit against the Mamluks, Egypt's ruling military caste.
en-000010119	General Bonaparte's forces of 25,000 roughly equalled those of the Mamluks'Egyptian cavalry.
en-000010120	His army had succeeded in a temporary increase of French power in Egypt, though it faced repeated uprisings.
en-000010121	In early 1799, he moved an army into the Ottoman province of Damascus (Syria and Galilee).
en-000010122	Bonaparte led these 13,000 French soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of Arish, Gaza, Jaffa, and Haifa.
en-000010123	Men, women, and children were robbed and murdered for three days.
en-000010124	He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre, so he marched his army back to Egypt in May.
en-000010125	Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir.
en-000010126	He learned that France had suffered a series of defeats in the War of the Second Coalition.
en-000010127	The army was left in the charge of Jean Baptiste Kléber.
en-000010128	By the time that he reached Paris in October, France's situation had been improved by a series of victories.
en-000010129	The Republic, however, was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular with the French population.
en-000010130	The Directory discussed Bonaparte's "desertion" but was too weak to punish him.
en-000010131	Despite the failures in Egypt, Napoleon returned to a hero's welcome.
en-000010132	Napoleon became "first consul" for ten years, with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only.
en-000010133	The constitution preserved the appearance of a republic but in reality established a dictatorship.
en-000010134	Napoleon established a political system that historian Martyn Lyons called "dictatorship by plebiscite."
en-000010135	The constitution was approved in a rigged plebiscite held the following January, with 99.94 percent officially listed as voting "yes."
en-000010136	After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies collided at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June.
en-000010137	The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back.
en-000010138	As negotiations became increasingly fractious, Bonaparte gave orders to his general Moreau to strike Austria once more.
en-000010139	Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at Hohenlinden in December 1800.
en-000010140	As a result, the Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801.
en-000010141	The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio.
en-000010142	Britain now remained the only nation that was still at war with France.
en-000010143	His broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution:"Article 1.
en-000010144	The French people name, and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life."
en-000010145	After 1802, he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte.
en-000010146	The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad.
en-000010147	Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens.
en-000010148	During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794.
en-000010149	The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself.
en-000010150	Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue.
en-000010151	Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army.
en-000010152	The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of $15 million.
en-000010153	Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens, but they inflamed tensions significantly.
en-000010154	On the advice of Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden.
en-000010155	The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, even though he had not been involved in the plot.
en-000010156	Enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe, becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars.
en-000010157	He believed that a Bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family's succession was entrenched in the constitution.
en-000010158	Launching yet another referendum, Napoleon was elected as "Emperor of the French" by a tally exceeding 99%.
en-000010159	Napoleon entered the ceremony wearing the laurel wreath and kept it on his head throughout the proceedings.
en-000010160	Instead he placed the crown on Josephine's head, the event commemorated in the officially sanctioned painting by Jacques-Louis David.
en-000010161	He created eighteen "Marshals of the Empire" from amongst his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army.
en-000010162	Great Britain had broken the Peace of Amiens by declaring war on France in May 1803.
en-000010163	In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement became the first step towards the creation of the Third Coalition.
en-000010164	By April 1805, Britain had also signed an alliance with Russia.
en-000010165	He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England.
en-000010166	They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations.
en-000010167	The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called "La Grande Armée".
en-000010168	However, the plan unraveled after the British victory at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in July 1805.
en-000010169	By August 1805, Napoleon had realized that the strategic situation had changed fundamentally.
en-000010170	His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive.
en-000010171	Austrian commander Karl Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Swabia.
en-000010172	Napoleon swung his forces to the southeast and the Grande Armée performed an elaborate wheeling movement that outflanked the Austrian positions.
en-000010173	The Ulm Maneuver completely surprised General Mack, who belatedly understood that his army had been cut off.
en-000010174	After Trafalgar, Britain had total domination of the seas for the duration of the Napoleonic Wars.
en-000010175	Following the Ulm Campaign, French forces managed to capture Vienna in November.
en-000010176	A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time.
en-000010177	The Allied disaster at Austerlitz significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort.
en-000010178	France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December.
en-000010179	Napoleon went on to say, "The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought."
en-000010180	Vincent Cronin disagrees, stating that Napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself, "he embodied the ambitions of thirty million Frenchmen".
en-000010181	In February 1806, Ottoman Emperor Selim III finally recognized Napoleon as "Emperor".
en-000010182	He also opted for an alliance with France, calling France "our sincere and natural ally."
en-000010183	That decision brought the Ottoman Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain.
en-000010184	A Franco-Persian alliance was also formed between Napoleon and the Persian Empire of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar.
en-000010185	It collapsed in 1807, when France and Russia themselves formed an unexpected alliance.
en-000010186	In the end, Napoleon had made no effective alliances in the Middle East.
en-000010187	After Austerlitz, Napoleon established the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806.
en-000010188	The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright.
en-000010189	War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806.
en-000010190	In the "bataillon-carré" system, the various corps of the "Grande Armée" would march uniformly together in close supporting distance.
en-000010191	If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help.
en-000010192	Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale.
en-000010193	Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force.
en-000010194	Historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian forces: "Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered."
en-000010195	Following his triumph, Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the Berlin Decree issued in November 1806.
en-000010196	The Continental System, which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain, was widely violated throughout his reign.
en-000010197	The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French.
en-000010198	On 19 June, Czar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon.
en-000010199	The latter assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe.
en-000010200	The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated: "I hate the English as much as you do."
en-000010201	Alexander faced pressure from his brother, Duke Constantine, to make peace with Napoleon.
en-000010202	Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia.
en-000010203	He then appointed his young brother Jérôme as the new monarch of this kingdom.
en-000010204	Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic era progressed.
en-000010205	The settlements at Tilsit gave Napoleon time to organize his empire.
en-000010206	One of his major objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British.
en-000010207	He decided to focus his attention on the Kingdom of Portugal, which consistently violated his trade prohibitions.
en-000010208	After defeat in the War of the Oranges in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy.
en-000010209	At first, John VI agreed to close his ports to British trade.
en-000010210	Unhappy with this change of policy by the Portuguese government, Napoleon sent an army to invade Portugal.
en-000010211	And governments must forswear changes in these policies, lest the uncertainty itself act as a transaction cost.
en-000010212	Napoleon appointed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808.
en-000010213	Before going to Iberia, Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians.
en-000010214	After clearing the last Spanish force guarding the capital at Somosierra, Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops.
en-000010215	He then unleashed his soldiers against Moore and the British forces.
en-000010216	Several months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future Duke of Wellington.
en-000010217	The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand.
en-000010218	The highlight of the conflict became the brutal "guerrilla warfare" that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside.
en-000010219	Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict.
en-000010220	After four years on the sidelines, Austria sought another war with France to avenge its recent defeats.
en-000010221	Frederick William of Prussia initially promised to help the Austrians, but reneged before conflict began.
en-000010222	In the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria.
en-000010223	The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion.
en-000010224	Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout.
en-000010225	In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated "Landshut Maneuver".
en-000010226	He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl.
en-000010227	By 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld.
en-000010228	On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling.
en-000010229	By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling.
en-000010230	A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island.
en-000010231	The British army only landed at Walcheren on 30 July, by which point the Austrians had already been defeated.
en-000010232	The Walcheren Campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed "Walcheren Fever."
en-000010233	Over 4000 British troops were lost in a bungled campaign, and the rest withdrew in December 1809.
en-000010234	The main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the French and the Austrians.
en-000010235	Emperor Francis wanted to wait and see how the British performed in their theater before entering into negotiations with Napoleon.
en-000010236	Once it became apparent that the British were going nowhere, the Austrians agreed to peace talks.
en-000010237	The resulting Treaty of Schönbrunn in October 1809 was the harshest that France had imposed on Austria in recent memory.
en-000010238	Austria lost over three million subjects, about one-fifth of her total population, as a result of these territorial changes.
en-000010239	Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Joséphine in January 1810 and started looking for a new wife.
en-000010240	His son never actually ruled the empire, but historians still refer to him as "Napoleon II".
en-000010241	In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander met at the Congress of Erfurt to preserve the Russo-French alliance.
en-000010242	The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807.
en-000010243	By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was under pressure from the Russian nobility to break off the alliance.
en-000010244	By 1812, advisers to Alexander suggested the possibility of an invasion of the French Empire and the recapture of Poland.
en-000010245	On receipt of intelligence reports on Russia's war preparations, Napoleon expanded his "Grande Armée" to more than 450,000 men.
en-000010246	Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created.
en-000010247	This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen.
en-000010248	Napoleon refused to manumit the Russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear.
en-000010249	The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.
en-000010250	The Russians avoided Napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia.
en-000010251	Although the French had won, the Russian army had accepted, and withstood, the major battle Napoleon had hoped would be decisive.
en-000010252	Napoleon's own account was:"The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow.
en-000010253	The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory, but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible."
en-000010254	Napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace.
en-000010255	However, on orders of the city's governor Feodor Rostopchin, rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned.
en-000010256	In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the Malet coup of 1812.
en-000010257	After Battle of Berezina Napoleon succeeded to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train.
en-000010258	On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left the army in a sledge.
en-000010259	The French suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the Russian Winter.
en-000010260	The Armée had begun as over 400,000 frontline troops, with fewer than 40,000 crossing the Berezina River in November 1812.
en-000010261	The Russians had lost 150,000 in battle and hundreds of thousands of civilians.
en-000010262	Heartened by France's loss in Russia, Prussia joined with Austria, Sweden, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal in a new coalition.
en-000010263	This was by far the largest battle of the Napoleonic Wars and cost more than 90,000 casualties in total.
en-000010264	The Allies offered peace terms in the Frankfurt proposals in November 1813.
en-000010265	Napoleon would remain as Emperor of France, but it would be reduced to its "natural frontiers."
en-000010266	Metternich's motivation was to maintain France as a balance against Russian threats, while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars.
en-000010267	Napoleon, expecting to win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had withdrawn the offer.
en-000010268	The French were surrounded: British armies pressed from the south, and other Coalition forces positioned to attack from the German states.
en-000010269	Napoleon won a series of victories in the Six Days'Campaign, though these were not significant enough to turn the tide.
en-000010270	The leaders of Paris surrendered to the Coalition in March 1814.
en-000010271	Long docile to Napoleon, under Talleyrand's prodding it had turned against him.
en-000010272	The next day, the Sénat passed the Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur ("Emperor's Demise Act"), which declared Napoleon deposed.
en-000010273	Napoleon had advanced as far as Fontainebleau when he learned that Paris was lost.
en-000010274	When Napoleon proposed the army march on the capital, his senior officers and marshals mutinied.
en-000010275	Napoleon asserted the army would follow him, and Ney replied the army would follow its generals.
en-000010276	Bowing to the inevitable, on 4 April Napoleon abdicated in favour of his son, with Marie-Louise as regent.
en-000010277	Napoleon was then forced to announce his unconditional abdication only two days later.
en-000010278	A few months into his exile, Napoleon learned that his ex-wife Josephine had died in France.
en-000010279	He was devastated by the news, locking himself in his room and refusing to leave for two days.
en-000010280	Two days later, he landed on the French mainland at Golfe-Juan and started heading north.
en-000010281	The 5th Regiment was sent to intercept him and made contact just south of Grenoble on 7 March 1815.
en-000010282	The two then marched together towards Paris with a growing army.
en-000010283	The unpopular Louis XVIII fled to Belgium after realizing he had little political support.
en-000010284	On 13 March, the powers at the Congress of Vienna declared Napoleon an outlaw.
en-000010285	Napoleon arrived in Paris on 20 March and governed for a period now called the Hundred Days.
en-000010286	The French Army of the North crossed the frontier into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, in modern-day Belgium.
en-000010287	Napoleon returned to Paris and found that both the legislature and the people had turned against him.
en-000010288	Realizing his position was untenable, he abdicated on 22 June in favour of his son.
en-000010289	With a small cadre of followers, Napoleon dictated his memoirs and grumbled about conditions.
en-000010290	There were rumors of plots and even of his escape, but in reality no serious attempts were made.
en-000010291	For English poet Lord Byron, Napoleon was the epitome of the Romantic hero, the persecuted, lonely, and flawed genius.
en-000010292	His personal physician, Barry O'Meara, warned London that his declining state of health was mainly caused by the harsh treatment.
en-000010293	Napoleon confined himself for months on end in his damp and wretched habitation of "Longwood".
en-000010294	He died on 5 May 1821, after confession, Extreme Unction and Viaticum in the presence of Father Ange Vignali.
en-000010295	His last words were, "France, l'armée, tête d'armée, Joséphine" ("France, army, head of the army, Joséphine").
en-000010296	Napoleon's original death mask was created around 6 May, although it is not clear which doctor created it.
en-000010297	In 1840, Louis Philippe I obtained permission from the British to return Napoleon's remains to France.
en-000010298	In 1861, Napoleon's remains were entombed in a porphyry sarcophagus in the crypt under the dome at Les Invalides.
en-000010299	Napoleon's physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found the cause of death to be stomach cancer.
en-000010300	Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, although this was seemingly unknown at the time of the autopsy.
en-000010301	In 1955, the diaries of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, were published.
en-000010302	Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period.
en-000010303	Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis.
en-000010304	Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind.
en-000010305	There have been modern studies that have supported the original autopsy finding.
en-000010306	All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 times higher than the current average.
en-000010307	Napoleon had a civil marriage with Joséphine de Beauharnais, without religious ceremony.
en-000010308	On 1 April 1810, Napoleon married the Austrian princess Marie Louise in a Catholic ceremony.
en-000010309	During his brother's rule in Spain, he abolished the Spanish Inquisition in 1813.
en-000010310	It solidified the Roman Catholic Church as the majority church of France and brought back most of its civil status.
en-000010311	The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely been resolved.
en-000010312	It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off.
en-000010313	As a part of the Concordat, he presented another set of laws called the Organic Articles.
en-000010314	While the Concordat restored much power to the papacy, the balance of church–state relations had tilted firmly in Napoleon's favour.
en-000010315	Similar arrangements were made with the Church in territories controlled by Napoleon, especially Italy and Germany.
en-000010316	Now, Napoleon could win favor with the Catholics while also controlling Rome in a political sense.
en-000010317	Napoleon said in April 1801,"Skillful conquerors have not got entangled with priests.
en-000010318	French children were issued a catechism that taught them to love and respect Napoleon.
en-000010319	It takes weakness to chase them out of the country, but it takes strength to assimilate them."
en-000010320	Historians emphasize the strength of the ambition that took Napoleon from an obscure village to command of most of Europe.
en-000010321	George F. E. Rudé stresses his "rare combination of will, intellect and physical vigour."
en-000010322	He understood military technology, but was not an innovator in that regard.
en-000010323	He was an innovator in using the financial, bureaucratic, and diplomatic resources of France.
en-000010324	Napoleon maintained strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing what needed to be done.
en-000010325	He cheated at cards, but repaid the losses; he had to win at everything he attempted.
en-000010326	In terms of influence on events, it was more than Napoleon's personality that took effect.
en-000010327	He reorganized France itself to supply the men and money needed for wars.
en-000010328	Napoleon has become a worldwide cultural icon who symbolises military genius and political power.
en-000010329	Martin van Creveld described him as "the most competent human being who ever lived".
en-000010330	Since his death, many towns, streets, ships, and even cartoon characters have been named after him.
en-000010331	He has been portrayed in hundreds of films and discussed in hundreds of thousands of books and articles.
en-000010332	During the Napoleonic Wars he was taken seriously by the British press as a dangerous tyrant, poised to invade.
en-000010333	The British Tory press has depicted Napoleon as much smaller than average height before, and that image persisted.
en-000010334	Confusion about his height results from the difference between the French pouce and British inch—2.71 cm and 2.54 cm, respectively.
en-000010335	The stock character of Napoleon is a comically short "petty tyrant" and this has become a cliché in popular culture.
en-000010336	This was in contrast to the complex uniforms with many decorations of his marshals and those around him.
en-000010337	He negotiated the Concordat of 1801 with the Catholic Church, which sought to reconcile the mostly Catholic population to his regime.
en-000010338	It was presented alongside the Organic Articles, which regulated public worship in France.
en-000010339	He has dissolved the Holy Roman Empire prior to German Unification later in the 19th century.
en-000010340	The sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States doubled the size of the United States.
en-000010341	Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts.
en-000010342	Napoleon said:"My true glory is not to have won forty battles ... Waterloo will erase the memory of so many victories.
en-000010343	The Code influences a quarter of the world's jurisdictions such as that of in Europe, the Americas and Africa.
en-000010344	The movement toward national unification in Italy was similarly precipitated by Napoleonic rule.
en-000010345	These changes contributed to the development of nationalism and the nation state.
en-000010346	The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and equality under the law was proclaimed for all men.
en-000010347	He continued the policy, which emerged from the Revolution, of promotion based primarily on merit.
en-000010348	These methods are now referred to as essential features of Napoleonic warfare.
en-000010349	Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change.
en-000010350	Antoine-Henri Jomini explained Napoleon's methods in a widely used textbook that influenced all European and American armies.
en-000010351	Under Napoleon, a new emphasis towards the destruction, not just outmanoeuvring, of enemy armies emerged.
en-000010352	Invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive.
en-000010353	The political effect of war increased; defeat for a European power meant more than the loss of isolated enclaves.
en-000010354	Near-Carthaginian peaces intertwined whole national efforts, intensifying the Revolutionary phenomenon of total war.
en-000010355	The official introduction of the metric system in September 1799 was unpopular in large sections of French society.
en-000010356	Napoleon's rule greatly aided adoption of the new standard not only across France but also across the French sphere of influence.
en-000010357	Napoleon's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of education in France and throughout much of Europe.
en-000010358	He left some primary education in the hands of religious orders, but he offered public support to secondary education.
en-000010359	Napoleon founded a number of state secondary schools ("lycées") designed to produce a standardized education that was uniform across France.
en-000010360	All students were taught the sciences along with modern and classical languages.
en-000010361	Napoleon made some of the first efforts at establishing a system of secular and public education.
en-000010362	Many historians have concluded that he had grandiose foreign policy ambitions.
en-000010363	His role in the Haitian Revolution and decision to reinstate slavery in France's oversea colonies are controversial and affect his reputation.

en-000010591	He received a Juris Doctor from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1986.
en-000010592	While in law school, he met wife, Mary Anderson, whom he married in 1987.
en-000010593	He later became vice president of a software as a service company, Wizmo Inc.
en-000010594	One year later, at age 28, he was elected to the City Council.
en-000010595	Pawlenty entered state politics in 1990 as a campaign advisor for Jon Grunseth's losing bid for Minnesota governor.
en-000010596	In response to a state budget surplus, he advocated for a tax reduction rather than expanded education funding.
en-000010597	In 2002, Pawlenty wanted to run for governor, but party leaders made it clear they favored businessman Brian Sullivan.
en-000010598	Pawlenty returned to his original ambition and won a hard-fought and narrow victory over Sullivan in the Republican party primary election.
en-000010599	His main rival was veteran Democratic–Farmer–Labor (DFL) state senator Roger Moe.
en-000010600	Until mid-October 2002, all three were essentially tied in the polls.
en-000010601	His largest gains after the October three-way tie were reportedly among voters in the suburbs of Minneapolis–St.
en-000010602	Pawlenty was elected in 2002 on a platform of balancing the state's budget without raising taxes.
en-000010603	He emphasized his campaign and first term with the Taxpayers League of Minnesota slogan "no new taxes."
en-000010604	His governorship was characterized by a historically low rate of spending growth.
en-000010605	In his first year as governor, Pawlenty inherited a projected two-year budget deficit of $4.3 billion, the largest in Minnesota's history.
en-000010606	The budget reduced the rate of funding increases for state services, including transportation, social services, and welfare.
en-000010607	It also enacted a perennial proposal to restructure city aid based on immediate need, rather than historical factors.
en-000010608	In negotiations the governor agreed to several compromises, abandoning a desired public employee wage freeze and property tax restrictions.
en-000010609	During his second term, Pawlenty erased a $2.7-billion deficit by cutting spending, shifting payments, and using one-time federal stimulus money.
en-000010610	Cutting welfare spending – where the big money is – would be painful.
en-000010611	His final budget (2010–2011) was the state's first two-year period since 1960 in which net government expenditures decreased.
en-000010612	The result was a $5-billion deficit, the seventh largest in the United States.
en-000010613	Minnesota property taxes rose $2.5 billion, more than the previous 16 years combined, and Moody's lowered the state's bond rating.
en-000010614	Carlson told "Time", "I don't think any governor has left behind a worse financial mess than he [Pawlenty] has."
en-000010615	Pawlenty responded, "My friend governor Arne Carlson is, of course, now an Obama and John Kerry supporter."
en-000010616	His budget had been the subject of a lawsuit in Ramsey County District Court, which was decided against him.
en-000010617	I will fight to reduce spending and taxes in Minnesota and that battle continues.
en-000010618	My commitment to the people of Minnesota remains the same: we will balance the budget without raising taxes.
en-000010619	Legislators also pushed a proposal to turn Canterbury Park horse track into a racino.
en-000010620	Tribes with casinos opposed the expanded gambling and some legislators objected on moral grounds that the state shouldn't exploit problem gamblers.
en-000010621	Politicians in heavy tribal areas feared losing campaign-finance sources if they supported the plan.
en-000010622	Delays by the Legislature ended with the bill being pulled from committee.
en-000010623	Pawlenty worked throughout 2006 to fund a Minnesota Twins baseball stadium in Minneapolis.
en-000010624	The bill also funded a $26-million expansion of the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management.
en-000010625	In the budget process, Pawlenty made an effort to preserve education funding while cutting other government spending.
en-000010626	Despite this, education funding fell from $9,700 to $8,400 per student (adjusted for inflation) during his tenure.
en-000010627	In 2010, the organization rated Minnesota#1 in the country for charter school promotion.
en-000010628	Renamed the "Minnesota Academic Standards," they were guided by Department of Education commissioner Cheri Pierson Yecke.
en-000010629	In her confirmation hearing, DFLers also noted concern over her conservative viewpoints.
en-000010630	In June 2006, Pawlenty proposed the "ACHIEVE" program for the top 25% of high school graduates.
en-000010631	However the program was not included in the 2007 higher education bill.
en-000010632	Pawlenty used an accounting change called a tax shift to balance the state deficit without raising taxes.
en-000010633	School districts statewide may unexpectedly lose $58 million in interest and reserve revenue.
en-000010634	Pawlenty found it "unnecessary" because MnSCU was fixing its system already "through internal actions and policy changes".
en-000010635	During Pawlenty's first term, urban traffic congestion was a significant concern of voters.
en-000010636	He appointed his lieutenant governor, Carol Molnau, as transportation commissioner, for which she was approved by the legislature in May 2004.
en-000010637	Molnau attempted to reform the transportation department, (Mn/DOT), using concepts such as "design-build".
en-000010638	Pawlenty favored raising fees and imposing toll lanes on roads as the primary means of discouraging excessive traffic.
en-000010639	During his term, the carpool lanes of Interstate 394 leading into downtown Minneapolis were converted into high-occupancy toll lanes.
en-000010640	In vetoing the expenditure, Pawlenty did not consult Peter Bell, head of the Metro Council and project leader.
en-000010641	They noted cuts overwhelmingly targeted Democratic districts, and Democratic stronghold Saint Paul most heavily.
en-000010642	Crime in Minnesota was a high-profile political issue during Pawlenty's governorship.
en-000010643	Pawlenty in turn criticized the capital city for poorly allocating its funding.
en-000010644	Pawlenty made two large efforts to expand penalties for sexual offenders.
en-000010645	In response to his first proposal in 2005, the state legislature passed a large package of sentencing reforms.
en-000010646	Pawlenty said that the economic benefits of illegal immigration did not justify the illegal behavior.
en-000010647	His proposal was challenged by DFL senators who preferred increased legal immigration to punitive action.
en-000010648	Minnesota has mandated a 10% mixture of gasoline and ethanol (gasohol) since 1997.
en-000010649	Pawlenty signed into law in May 2005 a bill that will raise the minimum mandated mixture to 20% in 2013.
en-000010650	Pawlenty has also lobbied the Governors'Ethanol Coalition to mandate higher ethanol use nationwide.
en-000010651	With Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, Pawlenty was co-chairman of the association's energy committee.
en-000010652	The effort received "adamant opposition" from governors of petroleum (oil) producing states.
en-000010653	These directed state agencies to develop a plan to reduce greenhouse gases, and "develop a market-based and multi-sector cap-and-trade mechanism".
en-000010654	However, by 2009 Pawlenty had reversed his position and called cap-and-trade "overly bureaucratic" and a potential "disaster".
en-000010655	She also angered many when it was learned she had delayed releasing government research on cancer in miners.
en-000010656	Later in his tenure he used health care funding cuts as a mechanism to balance the state budget.
en-000010657	State Senator Linda Berglin wrote a bill that would extend GAMC funding.
en-000010658	Pawlenty accepted a $500,000 abstinence-only sex-education grant that would require $350,000 in matching state money.
en-000010659	Pawlenty said, "It doesn't say we have to apply for all of them."
en-000010660	During his two terms Pawlenty made trips to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Kuwait visiting Minnesota troops.
en-000010661	Pawlenty was visited in 2004 by Mexican President Vicente Fox in talks to strengthen trade.
en-000010662	Pawlenty was the chairman of the National Governors Association for the 2007–2008 term.
en-000010663	He also served as Chair of the Midwestern Governors Association in 2006.
en-000010664	Beginning in 2005, Pawlenty was rumored in the press as a potential candidate for president of the United States.
en-000010665	On January 15, 2007, after being reelected, Pawlenty said,"I am committed to serving out my term as governor.
en-000010666	In 2008, Pawlenty expressed support for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).
en-000010667	I'm afraid that in 2012, if we're not honest enough, we may lose our country.”
en-000010668	In February 2005, ABC News identified him as a potential candidate for president.
en-000010669	In October 2009, a CNN article suggested that Pawlenty was contemplating a 2012 White House bid.
en-000010670	Among those advising him in preparation for a potential presidential run was lobbyist and former Congressman Vin Weber.
en-000010671	In late 2009, Pawlenty began taking steps that many saw as leading to a 2012 presidential bid.
en-000010672	He visited Iowa in November 2009 and April 2010, making political speeches.
en-000010673	In January 2011, the "New York Times" reported that "Few Americans, in fact, even know his name."
en-000010674	Pawlenty believes that state governments should outlaw abortion, except for cases of rape, incest, and to save a woman's life.
en-000010675	He thinks the United States Supreme Court decided "Roe v. Wade" wrongly, abortion being a state, not a federal, matter.
en-000010676	He opposes same-sex marriage and civil unions, and said on talk radio"...
en-000010677	I have been a public supporter of maintaining Don't ask, don't tell and I would support reinstating it as well".
en-000010678	In December 2010, Pawlenty was one of three U.S. governors who publicly declared solidarity with the Christian-right group Family Research Council.
en-000010679	"That will come up fast, " he said,"if I do run."
en-000010680	There's gonna be five, six, seven, eight people running… Whoever wants to run can run.
en-000010681	He also criticized modern unions:"The moral case for unions—protecting working families from exploitation—does not apply to public employment...
en-000010682	On Twitter, his spokesman said CNN took his comments out of context.
en-000010683	Before the Ames debate, he took a more aggressive stance against Romney, including the coining the term "Obamneycare".
en-000010684	When pressed by John King during CNN's June 13, 2011 debate to address why he used the word, he backed off.
en-000010685	The following day he announced his decision to withdraw from the presidential race.
en-000010686	He was to head the Financial Services Roundtable (FSR), a financial service industry lobby group in Washington, D.C.
en-000010687	He would not be running in the 2014 gubernatorial election in Minnesota nor in the state's 2014 senatorial election.
en-000010688	He replaced Steve Bartlett, a former U.S. Representative from Texas who had held the positions since 1999.
en-000010689	Pawlenty and his wife Mary have two daughters, Anna and Mara.
en-000010690	Mary was appointed as a judge of the Dakota County District Court in Hastings, Minnesota, in 1994.
en-000010691	She stayed on only briefly before departing for another dispute-resolution company, the Gilbert Mediation Center.
en-000010692	In a January 2011 interview, Mr. Pawlenty stated,"I love and respect and admire the Catholic Church.
en-000010693	I had to reconcile my faith life with my wife so we could have a consistent, integrated family faith life."
en-000010694	Pawlenty frequently uses (and is referred to by) the mononym "TPaw" or "T-Paw".
en-000010695	Pawlenty is generally considered a conservative on the American political spectrum.
en-000010696	With regard to his economic record, he has drawn mixed reviews from fiscally conservative interest groups.
en-000010697	In April 2009, 46% of Minnesotans approved of Pawlenty, while 40% disapproved.
en-000010698	In March 2010 42% of Minnesotans approved of Pawlenty, while 52% disapproved.
en-000010699	In October 2010 a Rasmussen report showed that Pawlenty had a 49% approval rating among Minnesotans with 49% disapproving.
en-000010700	A March 2011 survey by Gallup stated that Pawlenty began his Presidential run with only 41% name recognition in the GOP.
en-000010701	China has been on the Internet intermittently since May 1989 and on a permanent basis since 20 April 1994.
en-000010702	As of 2016, approximately 50 percent of China's population had internet connectivity.
en-000010703	By June 2014, there were 632 million internet users in the country and a penetration rate of 46.9%.
en-000010704	The number of users using mobile devices to access the Internet overtook those using PCs (83.4% and 80.9%, respectively).
en-000010705	China replaced the U.S. in its global leadership in terms of installed telecommunication bandwidth in 2011.
en-000010706	A majority of broadband subscribers are DSL, mostly from China Telecom and China Netcom.
en-000010707	The price varies in different provinces, usually around US$5– $20/month for a 4M- 100M ADSL/Fiber.
en-000010708	Broadband makes up the majority of Internet connections in China, with 363.81 million users at this service tier.
en-000010709	The price of a broadband connection places it well within the reach of the mainland Chinese middle class.
en-000010710	Wireless, especially Internet access through a mobile phone, has developed rapidly.
en-000010711	The number of dial-up users peaked in 2004 and since then has decreased sharply.
en-000010712	As of first half of 2010, the majority of the Web content is user-generated.
en-000010713	The first four major national networks, namely CSTNET, ChinaNet, CERNET and CHINAGBN, are the "backbone" of the mainland Chinese Internet.
en-000010714	Public Internet services are usually provided by provincial telecom companies, which sometimes are traded between networks.
en-000010715	According to Kaiser Kuo, the internet in China is largely used for entertainment purposes, being referred to as the "entertainment superhighway".
en-000010716	However, it also serves as the first public forum for Chinese citizens to freely exchange their ideals.
en-000010717	Most users go online to read news, to search for information, and to check their email.
en-000010718	They also go to BBS or web forums, find music or videos, or download files.
en-000010719	Chinese-language infotainment web portals such as Tencent, Sina.com, Sohu, and 163.com are popular.
en-000010720	Because the PRC government blocks many foreign websites, many homegrown copycats of foreign websites have appeared.
en-000010721	Baidu is the leading search engine in China, while most web portals also provide search opportunities like Soso.com.
en-000010722	As of 2015, Google has limited to no presence in China.
en-000010723	Although the Chinese write fewer emails, they enjoy other online communication tools.
en-000010724	Some Wikis such as the Soso Baike and Baidu Baike are "flourishing".
en-000010725	Until 2008 the Chinese Wikipedia could not be accessed from mainland China.
en-000010726	Since 2008, the government only blocks certain pages on Wikipedia which they deem to contain controversial content.
en-000010727	The rapidly increasing number of Internet users in China has also generated a large online shopping base in the country.
en-000010728	According to Sina.com, Chinese consumers with Internet access spend an average of RMB10,000 online annually.
en-000010729	China has endeavored to offer a number of online mapping services and allows the dissemination of geographic information within the country.
en-000010730	Soso maps, Baidu Maps (百度地圖) and Tianditu (天地圖) are typical examples.
en-000010731	Online mapping services can be understood as online cartography backed up by a geographic information system (GIS).
en-000010732	GIS was originally a tool for cartographers, geographers and other types of specialists to store, manage, present and analyze spatial data.
en-000010733	In bringing GIS online, the Web has made these tools available to a much wider audience.
en-000010734	Furthermore, with the advent of broadband, utilizing GIS has become much faster and easier.
en-000010735	Increasingly, non-specialist members of the public can access, look up and make use of geographic information for their own purposes.
en-000010736	As of January 2015, Alipay has 600 million counts of users and has the largest user group among all online-payment providers.
en-000010737	As of 2009, China is the largest market for online games.
en-000010738	The country has 368 million Internet users playing online games and the industry was worth US$13.5 billion in 2013.
en-000010739	Facebook had six million users in 2006; today, it has 1.4 billion.
en-000010740	Although restrictions on political information remain strong, several sexually oriented blogs began appearing in early 2004.
en-000010741	Many dating and "adult chat" sites, both Chinese and foreign, have been blocked.
en-000010742	The Golden Shield Project was proposed to the State Council by Premier Zhu Rongji in 1993.
en-000010743	However, the blocking of websites can be circumvented and is generally ineffective at preventing the flow of information to determined individuals.
en-000010744	Some argue that it is more effective at providing a Chilling effect rather than actually blocking content.
en-000010745	The Chinese Internet has provided some interesting tactics for the dissemination of news.
en-000010746	However, in fear of closure, online service providers sometimes hire moderators known as "big mama" to monitor user-provided content.
en-000010747	Forbes magazine featured an article entitled“Cracks In the Wall (27 February 2006):
en-000010748	The Baidu 10 Mythical Creatures, initially a humorous hoax, became a popular and widespread internet meme in China.
en-000010749	These ten hoaxes reportedly originated in response to increasing online censorship and have become an icon of netizens'resistance to it.
en-000010750	Many netizens believe the instruction follows the official embarrassment over the "Grass Mud Horse" and the "River Crab".
en-000010751	Soso.com, Baidu.com Inc, Sina Corp and Google Inc. remain the Top 4 in terms of market share.
en-000010752	Currently, Baidu has launched the CPA platform, and Sina Corp has launched an advertising scheme for intelligent investment.
en-000010753	The moves indicate a market trend of effective advertising with low cost.
en-000010754	Online advertisements of automobiles, real estate and finance will keep growing rapidly in the future.
en-000010755	The National Do Not Call Registry is intended to give U.S. consumers an opportunity to limit the telemarketing calls they receive.
en-000010756	To register by telephone (US), consumers may call 1-888-382-1222; or they may register via the web at the DoNotCall.gov registration page.
en-000010757	Separate laws and regulations apply to robocalls in the United States.
en-000010758	Registration for the Do-Not-Call list began on June 27, 2003, and enforcement started on October 1, 2003.
en-000010759	FCC regulations prohibit telemarketers from calling a cellular phone number with an automatic dialer under all circumstances.
en-000010760	The FTC responded by clarifying that cell phones cannot be called by telemarketers.
en-000010761	The do-not-call list was slated to take effect on October 1, 2003, but two federal district court decisions almost delayed it.
en-000010762	One from Oklahoma was overcome by special legislation giving the FTC specific jurisdiction over the matter.
en-000010763	The other from Colorado revolved around questions of regulation of commercial speech and threatened to delay implementation of the list.
en-000010764	However, President Bush signed a bill authorizing the no-call list to go ahead in September 2003.
en-000010765	Finally, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on February 17, 2004, upheld the constitutionality of the law.
en-000010766	Placing one's number on the National Do Not Call Registry will stop some, but not all, unsolicited calls.
en-000010767	Some attempts have been made by telemarketers to skirt the do-not-call list rules.
en-000010768	An example is the Dove Foundation, which places "survey" calls and then requests permission for a follow-up call.
en-000010769	The follow-up call is conducted by a for-profit company attempting to sell products.
en-000010770	At some point, companies will be ready to sell products, and market demand can take over.
en-000010771	This operation resulted in a restraining order in Missouri in March 2006.
en-000010772	The Federal Communications Commission has created rules implementing the National Do-Not-Call Implementation Act.
en-000010773	These rules are codified at the Code of Federal Regulations, title 47, Section 64.1200.
en-000010774	The rules should be consulted in order to determine whether a particular incident violated the rules and can result in enforcement.
en-000010775	Details of these rules can be found on the FCC's complaint form.
en-000010776	"When a consumer tells a company to stop calling or texting with promotional pitches, that request must be honored.
en-000010777	Today's settlement leaves no question that protecting consumer privacy is a top enforcement priority."
en-000010778	According to the 2009 Economic Report of the President, prepared by the Council of Economic Advisors,
en-000010779	Fats contain long hydrocarbon chains, which can either be unsaturated, i.e.
en-000010780	In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have "cis" as opposed to "trans" configurations.
en-000010781	"Trans" fats also occur naturally in a limited number of cases.
en-000010782	Vaccenyl and conjugated linoleyl (CLA) containing "trans" fats occur naturally in trace amounts in meat and dairy products from ruminants.
en-000010783	Most artificial "trans" fats are chemically different from natural "trans" fats.
en-000010784	In other countries, there are legal limits to "trans" fat content.
en-000010785	Other alternative formulations can also allow unsaturated fats to be used to replace saturated or partially hydrogenated fats.
en-000010786	Hydrogenated oil is not a synonym for "trans" fat: complete hydrogenation removes all unsaturated fats.
en-000010787	During the years 1905–1910, Normann built a fat-hardening facility in the Herford company.
en-000010788	At the same time, the invention was extended to a large-scale plant in Warrington, England, at "Joseph Crosfield& Sons, Limited."
en-000010789	Further success came from the marketing technique of giving away free cookbooks in which every recipe called for Crisco.
en-000010790	At the same time, there was not enough butterfat available for consumers.
en-000010791	Later, the means for storage, the refrigerator, was a factor in trans fat development.
en-000010792	In fact, by the 1980s, fats of animal origin had become one of the greatest concerns of dieticians.
en-000010793	The result was an almost overnight switch by most fast-food outlets to switch to trans fats.
en-000010794	Studies in the early 1990s, however, brought renewed scrutiny and confirmation of the negative health impact of trans fats.
en-000010795	In 1994, it was estimated that trans fats caused 20,000 deaths annually in the US from heart disease.
en-000010796	Mandatory food labeling for "trans" fats was introduced in several countries.
en-000010797	Campaigns were launched by activists to bring attention to the issue and change the practices of food manufacturers.
en-000010798	In chemical terms, "trans fat" is a fat (lipid) molecule that contains one or more double bonds in "trans" geometric configuration.
en-000010799	A double bond may exhibit one of two possible configurations: "trans" or "cis".
en-000010800	A fatty acid is characterized as either "saturated" or "unsaturated" based on the presence of double bonds in its structure.
en-000010801	If the molecule contains no double bonds, it is said to be saturated; otherwise, it is unsaturated to some degree.
en-000010802	Only unsaturated fats can be "trans""or ""cis" fat, since only a double bond can be locked to these orientations.
en-000010803	Saturated fatty acids are never called "trans fats" because they have no double bonds.
en-000010804	Other types of fatty acids, such as crepenynic acid, which contains a triple bond, are rare and of no nutritional significance.
en-000010805	Carbon atoms are tetravalent, forming four covalent bonds with other atoms, whereas hydrogen atoms bond with only one other atom.
en-000010806	This type of configuration is called "trans", from the Latin, meaning "across".
en-000010807	The trans configuration is the lower energy form, and is favored when catalytically equilibrated as a side reaction in hydrogenation.
en-000010808	For example, oleic acid and elaidic acid are both unsaturated fatty acids with the chemical formula CHCHO.
en-000010809	They both have a double bond located midway along the carbon chain.
en-000010810	It is the configuration of this bond that sets them apart.
en-000010811	The configuration has implications for the physical-chemical properties of the molecule.
en-000010812	The "trans" fatty acid elaidic acid has different chemical and physical properties, owing to the slightly different bond configuration.
en-000010813	This notably means that it is a solid at human body temperatures.
en-000010814	Instead, the goal is to decrease the number of double bonds and increase the amount of hydrogen in the fatty acid.
en-000010815	Production of trans fatty acids is therefore an undesirable side effect of partial hydrogenation.
en-000010816	Catalytic partial hydrogenation necessarily produces "trans"-fats, because of the reaction mechanism.
en-000010817	In the first reaction step, one hydrogen is added, with the other, coordinatively unsaturated, carbon being attached to the catalyst.
en-000010818	The second step is the addition of hydrogen to the remaining carbon, producing a saturated fatty acid.
en-000010819	The first step is reversible, such that the hydrogen is readsorbed on the catalyst and the double bond is re-formed.
en-000010820	The intermediate with only one hydrogen added contains no double bond and can freely rotate.
en-000010821	Thus, the double bond can re-form as either "cis" or "trans", of which "trans" is favored, regardless the starting material.
en-000010822	Complete hydrogenation also hydrogenates any produced "trans" fats to give saturated fats.
en-000010823	Blended with unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil, the high-pressure-processed oil produced margarine containing 5 to 6% trans fat.
en-000010824	Based on current U.S. labeling requirements (see below), the manufacturer could claim the product was free of trans fat.
en-000010825	The level of trans fat may also be altered by modification of the temperature and the length of time during hydrogenation.
en-000010826	The role of silver lies in its ability to form complexes with unsaturated compounds.
en-000010827	Natural "trans" fats, which include conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vaccenic acid, originate in the rumen of these animals.
en-000010828	Partially hydrogenated oils have been used in food for many reasons.
en-000010829	They are also an inexpensive alternative to other semi-solid oils such as palm oil.
en-000010830	Baking shortenings, unless reformulated, contain around 30% "trans" fats compared to their total fats.
en-000010831	In the early 21st century, non-hydrogenated vegetable oils that have lifespans exceeding that of the frying shortenings became available.
en-000010832	As fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations, trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations.
en-000010833	At KFC, the pattern was reversed with Hungary's product containing twice the trans fat of the New York product.
en-000010834	Even within the US there was variation, with fries in New York containing 30% more trans fat than those from Atlanta.
en-000010835	First, "trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health", whether of animal or plant origin.
en-000010836	Because of these facts and concerns, the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption.
en-000010837	There is no adequate level, recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats.
en-000010838	This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease.
en-000010839	Despite this concern, the NAS dietary recommendations have not recommended the elimination of trans fat from the diet.
en-000010840	The NAS has, therefore, "recommended that trans fatty acid consumption be as low as possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate diet".
en-000010841	Other studies though have shown different results when it comes to animal based trans fats like conjugated linoleic acid (CLA).
en-000010842	The exact biochemical methods by which trans fats produce specific health problems are a topic of continuing research.
en-000010843	High intake of trans fatty acids can lead to many health problems throughout one's life.
en-000010844	Trans fat has also been implicated in the development of Type 2 diabetes.
en-000010845	The primary health risk identified for trans fat consumption is an elevated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).
en-000010846	In this study, Hu and colleagues analyzed data from 900 coronary events from the study's population during 14 years of followup.
en-000010847	Hu also reports on the benefits of reducing trans fat consumption.
en-000010848	It should also be emphasized that much less is known about trans fat consumption in developing countries.
en-000010849	Replacing 2% of food energy from trans fat with non-trans unsaturated fats more than halves the risk of CHD (53%).
en-000010850	There are two accepted tests that measure an individual's risk for coronary heart disease, both blood tests.
en-000010851	The first considers ratios of two types of cholesterol, the other the amount of a cell-signalling cytokine called C-reactive protein.
en-000010852	The ratio test is more accepted, while the cytokine test may be more powerful but is still being studied.
en-000010853	The effect of trans fat consumption has been documented on each as follows:
en-000010854	There are suggestions that the negative consequences of trans fat consumption go beyond the cardiovascular risk.
en-000010855	The international trade in food is standardized in the Codex Alimentarius.
en-000010856	Hydrogenated oils and fats come under the scope of Codex Stan 19.
en-000010857	Since August 2006 food products should be labelled with the amount of trans fat in them.
en-000010858	The Australian federal government has indicated that it wants to pursue actively a policy of reducing trans fats from fast foods.
en-000010859	The former federal assistant health minister, Christopher Pyne, asked fast food outlets to reduce their trans fat usage.
en-000010860	A draft plan was proposed, with a September 2007 timetable, in order to reduce reliance on trans fats and saturated fats.
en-000010861	Currently, Australia's food labeling laws do not require trans fats to be shown separately from the total fat content.
en-000010862	However, margarine in Australia has been mostly free of trans fat since 1996.
en-000010863	Trans fat content limited to 4% of total fat, 2% on products that contain more than 20% fat.
en-000010864	On 31 July 2006, such labelling of trans fat contents became mandatory.
en-000010865	Products with less than 0.2 grams of trans fat per serving may be labeled as free of trans fats.
en-000010866	These labelling allowances are not widely known, but as an awareness of them develops, controversy over truthful labelling is growing.
en-000010867	In Canada, trans fat quantities on labels include naturally occurring trans fats from animal sources.
en-000010868	On 1 January 2008, Calgary became the first city in Canada to reduce trans fats from restaurants and fast food chains.
en-000010869	Trans fats present in cooking oils may not exceed 2% of the total fat content.
en-000010870	Of the 211 respondents to the study, most were women who purchased most of the food for their household.
en-000010871	When asked how they decide what food to buy, the most important factors were price, nutritional value, and need.
en-000010872	This means that trans fat is not on their minds unless they are specifically told of it.
en-000010873	When asked if they ever heard about trans fat, 98% said, "Yes."
en-000010874	Also, 79% said that they only knew a little about trans fats, and could have been more educated.
en-000010875	Respondents aged 41–60 were more likely to view trans fat as a major health concern, compared to ages 18–40.
en-000010876	This is because taste and food gratification take precedence over perceived risk to health.
en-000010877	The limit is 2% of fats and oils destined for human consumption.
en-000010878	This restriction is on the "ingredients" rather than the final products.
en-000010879	Total trans fat content was limited in 2010 to 2% of total fat content.
en-000010880	Since 2014, It is obligatory to mark food products with more than 2% (by weight) fat.
en-000010881	Switzerland followed Denmark's trans fats ban, and implemented its own beginning in April 2008.
en-000010882	Unfortunately, since this report there is no action in this way by legislatives authorities.
en-000010883	In October 2005, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) asked for better labelling in the UK.
en-000010884	In the edition of 29 July 2006 of the "British Medical Journal", an editorial also called for better labelling.
en-000010885	Sainsbury's became the first UK major retailer to ban all trans fat from all their own brand foods.
en-000010886	Asda, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Tesco, Unilever and United Biscuits are some of 73 businesses who have agreed to do so.
en-000010887	Many health professionals are not happy with the voluntary nature of the deal.
en-000010888	Before 2006, consumers in the United States could not directly determine the presence (or quantity) of trans fats in food products.
en-000010889	This information could only be inferred from the ingredient list, notably from the partially hydrogenated ingredients.
en-000010890	In 2010, according to the FDA, the average American consumed 5.8 grams of trans fat per day (2.6% of energy intake).
en-000010891	Monoglycerides and diglycerides are not considered fats by the FDA, despite their nearly equal calorie per weight contribution during actual ingestion.
en-000010892	The new labeling rule became mandatory across the board, even for companies that petitioned for extensions, on 1 January 2008.
en-000010893	The FDA defines trans fats as containing one or more "trans" linkage that are not in a conjugated system.
en-000010894	The American Public Health Association adopted a new policy statement regarding trans fats in 2007.
en-000010895	They also urge federal, state, and local governments to ban and monitor use of trans fats in restaurants.
en-000010896	This would have the effect of virtually eliminating trans fats from the US food supply.
en-000010897	The state of California and some US cities are acting to reduce consumption of trans fats.
en-000010898	In May 2005, Tiburon, California, became the first American city wherein all restaurants voluntarily cook with trans fat-free oils.
en-000010899	Montgomery County, Maryland approved a ban on partially hydrogenated oils, becoming the first county in the nation to restrict trans fats.
en-000010900	The board voted to ban trans fat in restaurant food on 5 December 2006.
en-000010901	New York was the first large US city to strictly limit trans fats in restaurants.
en-000010902	By 1 September 2007, eateries must cease frying food in trans fats.
en-000010903	A year later, trans fat must not be used as an ingredient in commercial kitchens.
en-000010904	The law does not apply to prepackaged foods sold in the city.
en-000010905	On 10 October 2007, the Philadelphia City Council approved the use of trans fats by small bakeries throughout the city.
en-000010906	Nassau County, a suburban county on Long Island, New York, banned trans fats in restaurants effective 1 April 2008.
en-000010907	Albany County of New York passed a ban on trans fats.
en-000010908	The ban was adopted after a unanimous vote by the county legislature on 14 May 2007.
en-000010909	The decision was made after New York City's decision, but no plan has been put into place.
en-000010910	San Francisco officially asked its restaurants to stop using trans fat in January 2008.
en-000010911	The voluntary program will grant a city decal to restaurants that comply and apply for the decal.
en-000010912	Maryland and Vermont were considering statewide bans of trans fats as of March 2007.
en-000010913	King County, Washington passed a ban on artificial trans fats effective 1 February 2009.
en-000010914	On 25 July 2008, California became the first state to ban trans fats in restaurants effective 1 January 2010.
en-000010915	As of 1 January 2011, doughnuts and other baked goods have been prohibited from containing artificial trans fats.
en-000010916	Packaged foods are not covered by the ban and can legally contain trans fats.
en-000010917	Trans fat must be removed from prepared foods within three years by June 2018.
en-000010918	The benefits are estimated at $140 billion over 20 years mainly from lower health care spending.
en-000010919	The separately marketed trans fat free version introduced in 2004 was discontinued.
en-000010920	Some major food chains have chosen to remove or reduce trans fats in their products.
en-000010921	In other cases, however, food vendors have been targeted by legal action that has generated a lot of media attention.
en-000010922	Major fast food chain menus and product lines with significant artificial trans fat include Popeyes
en-000010923	burger patty, and smaller amounts in fatty dairy products such as cheese, butter and cream.
en-000010924	Naturally occurring trans fat causes the Baconator, for example, to have 2.5 grams; each 1/4 lb.
en-000010925	A large chain's large fries typically had about 6 grams until around 2007.
en-000010926	High levels of trans fats remain common in packaged baked goods.
en-000010927	The session was held from 18 May 1848 to 31 May 1849, in the Paulskirche at Frankfurt am Main.
en-000010928	Its existence was both part of and the result of the "March Revolution" in the states of the German Confederation.
en-000010929	The parliament also proposed a constitutional monarchy headed by a hereditary emperor ("Kaiser").
en-000010930	In 1806, the Emperor, Francis II had relinquished the crown of the Holy Roman Empire and dissolved the Empire.
en-000010931	This was the result of the Napoleonic Wars and of direct military pressure from Napoléon Bonaparte.
en-000010932	Austria dominated this system of loosely connected, independent states, but the system failed to account for the rising influence of Prussia.
en-000010933	Apart from this nationalist component, calls for civic rights influenced political discourse.
en-000010934	The Napoleonic "Code Civil" had led to the introduction of civic rights in some German states in the early 19th century.
en-000010935	Furthermore, some German states had adopted constitutions after the foundation of the German Confederacy.
en-000010936	Between 1819 and 1830, the Carlsbad Decrees and other instances of Restoration politics limited such developments.
en-000010937	The mid-1840s saw an increase of the frequency of internal crises.
en-000010938	Additionally, a series of bad harvests in parts of Germany, notably the southwest, led to widely spread famine-related unrest.
en-000010939	The changes caused by the beginnings of industrialisation exacerbated social and economic tensions considerably.
en-000010940	Especially in south west Germany, censorship could not effectively suppress the press.
en-000010941	At such rallies by as the Offenburg Popular Assembly of September 1847, radical democrats called to overthrow the "status quo".
en-000010942	In many European states, the resistance against Restoration policies increased and led to revolutionary unrest.
en-000010943	The Bundestag (or Bundesversammlung), made up of representatives of the individual princes, was the only institution representing the whole confederation.
en-000010944	Two weeks later, news of the successful coup in France fanned the flames of the revolutionary mood.
en-000010945	The revolution on German soil began in Baden, with the occupation of the "Ständehaus" at Karlsruhe.
en-000010946	Within a few days and weeks, the revolts spread to the other German principalities.
en-000010947	On 5 March 1848, opposition politicians and state deputies met at the Heidelberg Assembly to discuss these issues.
en-000010948	They resolved to form a "Vorparlament" (a pre-parliament), which was to prepare the elections for a national constitutional assembly.
en-000010949	The new parliament and constitutional assembly will have to lead the negotiations with the SCAF.
en-000010950	They also elected a "Committee of Seven" ("Siebenerausschuss"), which proceeded to invite 500 individuals to Frankfurt.
en-000010951	The electoral law for the new national assembly was up to the individual states of the confederation, who chose different solutions.
en-000010952	Württemberg, Holstein, the Electorate of Hesse-Kassel (Hesse-Cassel) and the four remaining free cities (Hamburg, Lübeck, Bremen and Frankfurt) held direct elections.
en-000010953	The definition of independence was handled differently from state to state and was frequently the subject of vociferous protests.
en-000010954	Even with restrictions, however, it is estimated that about 85% of the male population could vote.
en-000010955	Originally, 649 electoral districts had been agreed upon, but eventually only approximately 585 members were elected.
en-000010956	95% of deputies had the "abitur", more than three quarters had been to university, half of which had studied jurisprudence.
en-000010957	A considerable number of deputies were members of a "Corps" or a "Burschenschaft".
en-000010958	the "Germanisten-Tage" of 1846 and 1847, were often the only occasions where national themes could be discussed freely.
en-000010959	A few of them, e.g.. Wolff, already saw themselves as explicit socialists.
en-000010960	Heinrich von Gagern, one of the best-known liberals throughout Germany, was elected president of the parliament.
en-000010961	These "Fraktionen" were perceived as clubs and thus usually named after the location of their meetings; generally, they were quite unstable.
en-000010962	In his memoirs, the deputy Robert Mohl wrote about the formation and functioning of the Clubs:
en-000010963	Partially for this reason, influential European powers, including France and Russia, declined to recognize the Parliament.
en-000010964	Johann named as August von Jochmus as Foreign Minister and Navy minister.
en-000010965	Influenced by the general nationalist atmosphere, the political situation in Schleswig and Holstein became especially explosive.
en-000010966	Then, under orders from the German Confederation, Prussian troops occupied Schleswig-Holstein.
en-000010967	On 26 August Prussia and Denmark, under pressure from Britain, Russia and France, signed a ceasefire in Malmö (Sweden).
en-000010968	Its terms included the withdrawal of all soldiers from Schleswig-Holstein and a shared administration of the land.
en-000010969	As Dahlmann was unable to form a new government, Anton von Schmerling succeeded Leiningen.
en-000010970	Henceforth, the radical democrats, whose views were both leftist and nationalist, ceased to accept their representation through the National Assembly.
en-000010971	In several states of the German Confederation, they resorted to individual revolutionary activities.
en-000010972	For example, on 21 September, Gustav Struve declared a German republic at Lörrach, thus starting the second democratic rising in Baden.
en-000010973	The execution also indicated that the force of the March Revolution was beginning to flag by the autumn of 1848.
en-000010974	In Prussia, the Prussian National Assembly was disbanded and its draft constitution rejected.
en-000010975	The definition of the national unity of German was a major difficulty for the Frankfurt National Assembly.
en-000010976	Similarly, the delegates decided to incorporate the Prussian Province of Posen, against the wishes of the Polish population.
en-000010977	The supporters of the "Großdeutsche Lösung" ("Greater German Solution"), however, supported Austria's incorporation.
en-000010978	On 27 October 1848, the National Assembly voted for a Greater German Solution, but incorporating only "Austria's German lands".
en-000010979	The Austrian emperor Ferdinand I was, however, not willing to break up his state.
en-000010980	The allocation of votes in the "Staatenhaus" (§ 87) also allowed for a later Austrian entry.
en-000010981	It could make use of the preparatory work done by the Committee of Seventeen appointed earlier by the "Bundesversammlung".
en-000010982	After long and controversial negotiations, the parliament passed the complete Imperial Constitution on 28 March 1849.
en-000010983	Half of each "Staatenhaus" delegation was to be appointed by the respective state government, the other by the state parliament.
en-000010984	The vote was carried by 290 votes against 248 abstentions, embodying resistance primarily by all left-wing, southern German and Austrian deputies.
en-000010985	The November 1848 discussion of Bassermann and Hergenhahn with Friedrich Wilhelm IV were also aiming in the same direction.
en-000010986	He declined, arguing that he could not accept the crown without the agreement of the princes and Free Cities.
en-000010987	This spelled the final failure of the Frankfurt Parliament's constitution and thus of the German March revolution.
en-000010988	Mainly smaller states accepted the constitution reluctantly, Württemberg was the only kingdom to do so after much hesitation.
en-000010989	The new elections called for by von Gagern did not take place, further weakening the assembly.
en-000010990	In the following week, nearly all conservative and bourgeois-liberal deputies left the parliament.
en-000010991	From their perspective, they represented a legitimate national executive power acting against states that had breached the constitution.
en-000010992	Nonetheless, only the radical democratic left was willing to use force to support the constitution, notwithstanding their original reservations against it.
en-000010993	On 14 May, the Grandduke of Baden, Leopold had to flee the country after a mutiny of the Rastatt garrison.
en-000010994	The insurrectionists declared a Baden Republic and formed a revolutionary government headed by the Paulskirche deputy Lorenz Brentano.
en-000010995	Together with Baden soldiers that had joined their side, they formed an army under the leadership of the Polish general Mieroslawski.
en-000010996	From 6 June 1849 onwards, the remaining 154 deputies met in Stuttgart.
en-000010997	At this point, the rump parliament had only 99 deputies and did not reach a quorum according to its own rules.
en-000010998	On 18 June, the Württemberg army occupied the parliamentary chamber before the session started.
en-000010999	The deputies reacted by organizing an impromptu protest march which was promptly squashed by the soldiers without bloodshed.
en-000011000	This entailed modifying the Frankfurt Parliament's conclusions, with a stronger role for the Prussian hereditary monarch and imposed "from above".
en-000011001	The "Erbkaiserliche" around Gagern supported this policy in the Gotha Post-Parliament and the Erfurt Union Parliament.
en-000011002	The 1850 Punctuation of Olmütz forced Prussia to abandon the policy.
en-000011003	Nevertheless, the March Revolution led to a major increase of Prussia's political importance.
en-000011004	On the other hand, the Prussian kingdom was now in a far better strategic position.
en-000011005	The work of the National Assembly and more generally of the March revolution was judged harshly in the immediate aftermath.
en-000011006	Authors such as Ludwig Häuser classed the ideas of the radical democratic left as irresponsible and naive foolishness.
en-000011007	It is probably partially due to this that Bassrmann committed suicide in 1855.
en-000011008	It is headquartered in Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and has 11,154 regular employees.
en-000011009	The cargo division operates 91 pure freighter flights weekly to 33 destinations.
en-000011010	During the 1960s, China Airlines was able to establish its first scheduled routes.
en-000011011	In October 1962, a flight from Taipei to Hualien became the airline's first domestic service.
en-000011012	Later, with the introduction of Caravelle and Boeing 727-100s,the airlines introduced international flights to South Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Japan.
en-000011013	With the airlines'first two Boeing 707 aircraft, trans-Pacific flights to San Francisco via Tokyo were initiated on February 2, 1970.
en-000011014	Shortly thereafter, four brand new Boeing 747SP (Special Performance) were introduced in 1977.
en-000011015	It also allowed the airlines to introduce flights to Saudi Arabia and South Africa.
en-000011016	Following the introduction of 747-200s, the airlines introduced its first European destination, Amsterdam.
en-000011017	The premise being that air carriers from the PRC and Taiwan were prevented crossing paths at any Japanese airports.
en-000011018	Thus CAL's Osaka service, due to the city's only airport at Itami, would not be reinstated until years later.
en-000011019	Adversely, other regional airports such as Bangkok, Singapore and Manila were entirely spared of this indignity imposed on Japan by China.
en-000011020	The next 20 years saw sporadic but far-reaching growth for the company.
en-000011021	Later CAL would place one of the largest orders for the newest Boeing 747.
en-000011022	As a result, in the mid-1990s, China Airlines subsidiary Mandarin Airlines took over some of its Sydney and Vancouver international routes.
en-000011023	Throughout the 1990s, the airline employed many ex-ROC Air Force pilots.
en-000011024	In addition, the company began recruiting university graduates as trainees in its own pilot training program.
en-000011025	(The aircraft took off from Taoyuan Airport, stopped over at Hong Kong Airport, and landed at Shanghai Pudong Airport.)
en-000011026	This was marked by an update to the logo of the airline and the typeface in which "China Airlines" is printed.
en-000011027	The carrier was the first Taiwanese airline to join an airline alliance.
en-000011028	In December 2013, China Airlines announced its new joint venture with Singaporean low cost carrier Tigerair Holdings to establish Tigerair Taiwan.
en-000011029	The new airline flew its inaugural flight to Singapore on 26 September 2014 and became the first low-cost carrier in Taiwan.
en-000011030	The plan, designed to refresh the carrier's brand image, includes fleet replacements, product innovations, and new uniform introductions.
en-000011031	In June 2015, the William Chang-designed new uniforms debuted; in August 2015, the flight attendants started appearing in the new uniforms.
en-000011032	In September 2016, the airline received its first Airbus A350-900XWB, featuring a second version of next generation China Airlines cabin design.
en-000011033	Future phases of the plan includes the retirement of the Boeing 747-400 and Airbus A340-300.
en-000011034	Also anticipated is the announcement of new narrow-body and regional wide-body orders.

en-000011040	Prior to introducing the current "plum blossom" livery in 1995, the livery of China Airlines featured Taiwan's flag on the tail.
en-000011041	The livery-change was due to political pressure from the Chinese government.
en-000011042	The mainland government prohibited any aircraft displaying Taiwan's flag to land in the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau.
en-000011043	This forced China Airlines to change its corporate identity in order to avoid having operations affected.
en-000011044	In 2011, after joining Skyteam, the carrier made alterations to its logo as part of refreshing the brand image.
en-000011045	China Airlines has had many uniforms since its establishment in 1959.

en-000011054	In 2009, a new air service agreement allowed China Airlines to start regularly scheduled flights to the Mainland.
en-000011055	Other long-haul network plans include upgrading aircraft types and altering routings.

en-000011065	Fleet overhaul is expected to be done at a rate of one aircraft per month.
en-000011066	Upon completion, the program will homogenize the layout of the A330-300 fleet.
en-000011067	The airline has been leasing various Airbus A330-300s and Boeing 737-800s to meet short term demands.

en-000011074	In early 2015, due to improving global economic conditions, the carrier decided to reactivate 1 stored freighter plane.
en-000011075	Such relationships will be all the more crucial if global economic conditions deteriorate.
en-000011076	However, as demand has once again decreased, the plan has been put on hold.
en-000011077	The first China Airlines special livery, the "Taiwan Touch Your Heart" tourism-promotional livery, was introduced in 2003.
en-000011078	The project was a collaboration between the carrier and the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan.
en-000011079	However, the plane was painted back to the normal livery before it left the hangar.
en-000011080	Currently, China Airlines has a total of 7 special livery aircraft in service.
en-000011081	China Airlines has twice partnered with Boeing to introduce planes carrying the combined livery-design of the two companies.

en-000011154	Interstate 80 (Keystone Shortway) runs east and west through the township with an exit at Pennsylvania Route 339, southwest of Mifflinville.
en-000011155	In 1799, the township was formed from part of Catawissa Township and named for Thomas Mifflin, governor of Pennsylvania.
en-000011156	As of the census of 2000, there were 2,251 people, 899 households, and 674 families residing in the township.

en-000011165	In the US until the past three decades, local school districts were responsible for education.
en-000011166	It serves about 2,100 students and features three academic buildings and one administration building.
en-000011167	It's expected to be near completion by the beginning of the 2007-2008 school year.
en-000011168	The earliest surviving historical references are in the royal charter authorising the construction of Holyrood Abbey in 1128.
en-000011169	The port remains one of its most valuable enterprises, handling over 1.5 million tonnes of cargo a year in 2003.
en-000011170	South Leith was larger and was controlled by the lairds of Restalrig: the Logan family.
en-000011171	It was based on trade and had many merchants'houses and warehouses.
en-000011172	This was where ships offloaded their cargoes at The Shore where they were collected by Edinburgh merchants.
en-000011173	North Leith was smaller but proportionately richer, coming under the jurisdiction of Holyrood Abbey.
en-000011174	It was effectively a fishing village consisting of one street, now Sandport Street and Quayside Lane.
en-000011175	This has traditionally been the shipbuilding side of Leith with several wet and dry docks built over time.
en-000011176	The first dry dock in Scotland was built here in 1720.
en-000011177	The bridge was a toll bridge, the revenue supplementing the church's income.
en-000011178	Reputedly Leith's oldest building, it was demolished in 1780 to allow ships to sail further upstream.
en-000011179	Amongst the finds were medieval wharf edges from the 12th century.
en-000011180	This date fits with the earliest documentary evidence of settlement in Leith- the foundation charter of Holyrood Abbey.
en-000011181	Leith has played a long and prominent role in Scottish history.
en-000011182	Mary of Guise ruled Scotland from Leith in 1560 as Regent while her daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots remained in France.
en-000011183	Mary of Guise moved the Scottish Court to Leith, to a site that is now Parliament Street, off Coalhill.
en-000011184	According to the 18th-century historian William Maitland, her palace was situated on Rotten Row, now Water Street.
en-000011185	John Knox records the delight of Mary of Guise at the failure of the attack, and English sources report 1000 casualties.
en-000011186	This rampart became the line of one of Edinburgh's longest streets, Leith Walk.
en-000011187	All that remains of the fort today is a vaulted trance in Dock Street which was its main entrance.
en-000011188	The fort was in active use until 1955, latterly serving for National Service training.
en-000011189	A pair of the old fort's gatehouses survive at the southern entrance to the scheme.
en-000011190	From the twelfth century South Leith was part of the parish of Restalrig and had no church of its own.
en-000011191	After the Scottish Reformation the principal parish kirk for Leith was South Leith Parish Church, originally constructed in 1483.
en-000011192	In June 1811 a statistical population census gave the population of South Leith as 15,938; North Leith 4,875.
en-000011193	Leith Docks became known as the port for Edinburgh and modest shipbuilding and repair facilities grew.
en-000011194	The same year the Trinity House in Kirkgate was erected in Grecian architectural style at an expense of £2500.
en-000011195	The council and government's'Leith Project'provided a further economic boost.
en-000011196	According to Keynesian economics, governments should boost total demand through quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus.
en-000011197	The result became very unsatisfactory, and half of Leith was provided with no municipal government whatever or any local magistrates.
en-000011198	The site was chosen as part of a design-and-build competition against other sites at Haymarket and Marionville.
en-000011199	It did further foster Leith's growing reputation as a white-collar, small business location.
en-000011200	Further large-scale service and tourist development followed, including the Ocean Terminal shopping centre and the permanently moored Royal Yacht Britannia.
en-000011201	Streets in Leith include Constitution Street, Great Junction Street, Henderson Street, Bernard Street, Leith Walk and Easter Road.
en-000011202	Development was sporadic with only certain sections following the original feuing.
en-000011203	Many streets are named after events or people of the time:
en-000011204	A centrepiece of the whole development was Leith Fort, built along the lines of Fort George in 1780.
en-000011205	This was demolished in 1955 having continued to serve a military function until that time.
en-000011206	A housing scheme was then built on its site by Edinburgh Council and named Fort House.
en-000011207	Some equivalent, less structured Georgian development happened on the east side of Leith, again their date evidenced in street names:
en-000011208	A regular stage coach service ran between Bernard Street and Edinburgh's Old Town from the mid-18th century.
en-000011209	By 1863 this had become a horse-drawn omnibus running every 5 minutes from 9am to 10pm.
en-000011210	This was put on tracks sometime around 1880 effectively then becoming a horse-drawn tram.
en-000011211	Leith was the first town in Scotland to electrify its tram system (1905).
en-000011212	Steam trains arrived in the 1840s, being some of the earliest lines in Britain.
en-000011213	There were four railway termini in Leith, but Beeching and the successive governments closed them all.
en-000011214	One station, nicknamed "Leith Citadel", on Commercial Street (now a youth centre) is the second oldest in Scotland (1847).
en-000011215	Leith offered ferry services to many European ports, including Hamburg and Oslo.
en-000011216	Leith has a long history of pioneering social advances, some of which were the first of their kind in Scotland:
en-000011217	A free hospital service was provided from 1777, paid for by a local tax, with beds sponsored by local shops.
en-000011218	Leith had electric street lighting from 1890 and electric trams from 1905 (only Blackpool was earlier in the UK).
en-000011219	The first public sewer in Scotland was built in Bernard Street in 1780; this flowed into the Water of Leith.
en-000011220	The iron seal over the end of the sewer is still visible next to Bernard Street bridge.
en-000011221	The sewage is now pumped in the opposite direction (it was laid to fall westwards) to Seafield.
en-000011222	Leith was formerly a port linked to the trade of the Hanseatic League.
en-000011223	Today it is a multicultural community with sizeable African-Caribbean, Asian and Eastern Europe an participation.
en-000011224	Leith FM (later renamed Castle FM) started as a week-long RSL station during the late 1990s, linked to Leith Festival.

en-000011226	Leith is the home of Hibernian Football Club which is a member of the Scottish Championship.
en-000011227	Leith Athletic Football Club have been part of Leith's sporting culture since their foundation in 1887 until closure in 1955.
en-000011228	Leith Links have been used a sports and recreation area over many centuries.
en-000011229	Leith Links also have one of the longest established cricket pitches in Scotland, from 1820.
en-000011230	There have been seven Congress Prime Ministers, the first being Jawaharlal Nehru (1947–64), and the most recent Manmohan Singh (2004–14).
en-000011231	The party's social liberal platform is generally considered to be on the centre-left of Indian politics.
en-000011232	In Assam, Kerala and Uttarakhand it shared power with its alliance partners.
en-000011233	The Congress has previously directly ruled Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab and Goa.
en-000011234	The history of the Indian National Congress (INC) falls into two distinct eras:
en-000011235	The Congress was founded in 1885 by Indian and British members of the Theosophical Society movement, including Scotsman Allan Octavian Hume.
en-000011236	Hume organised the first meeting in Bombay with the approval of the Viceroy Lord Dufferin.
en-000011237	In protest, a number of leaders – Chittaranjan Das, Annie Besant, and Motilal Nehru – resigned to set up the Swaraj Party.
en-000011238	After the First World War, the party became associated with Mahatma Gandhi, who remained its unofficial spiritual leader and icon.
en-000011239	Although its members were predominantly Hindu, it had members from other religions, economic classes, and ethnic and linguistic groups.
en-000011240	The British government allowed provincial elections in India in the winter of 1936–37 under the Government of India Act 1935.
en-000011241	Elections were held in eleven provinces – Madras, Central Provinces, Bihar, Orissa, United Provinces, Bombay Presidency, Assam, NWFP, Bengal, Punjab and Sindh.
en-000011242	The All-India Muslim League failed to form the government in any province.
en-000011243	The party was not the sole representative of the Indian polity – other parties including Hindu Mahasabha and Forward Bloc.
en-000011244	The party was an umbrella organisation, sheltering radical socialists, traditionalists, and Hindu and Muslim conservatives.
en-000011245	In 1943 Azad Hind – an Indian provisional government – had been established in Singapore and was supported by Japan.
en-000011246	The team included several famous lawyers, including Bhulabhai Desai, Asaf Ali, and Jawaharlal Nehru.
en-000011247	After Indian independence in 1947, the Indian National Congress became the dominant political party in the country.
en-000011248	The party held power nationally until 1977 when it was defeated by the Janata coalition.
en-000011249	It returned to power in 1980 and ruled until 1989, when it was once again defeated.
en-000011250	Congress gained power in landslide victories in the general elections of 1951–52, 1957, and 1962.
en-000011251	He believed the establishment of basic and heavy industries was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy.
en-000011252	During his period in office, there were four known assassination attempts on Nehru.
en-000011253	The first attempt on his life was during partition in 1947 while he was visiting North-West Frontier Province in a car.

en-000011431	Biofuels can be derived directly from plants, or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes.
en-000011432	Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis.
en-000011433	This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion.
en-000011434	This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form.
en-000011435	Cellulosic biomass, derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production.
en-000011436	Current plant design does not provide for converting the lignin portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.
en-000011437	Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe.
en-000011438	The world's largest biodiesel producer is the European Union, accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.
en-000011439	As of 2011, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states or provinces.
en-000011440	Most transportation fuels are liquids, because vehicles usually require high energy density.
en-000011441	High energy density can also be provided by an internal combustion engine.
en-000011442	The fuels that are easiest to burn cleanly are typically liquids and gases.
en-000011443	Thus, liquids meet the requirements of being both energy-dense and clean-burning.
en-000011444	In addition, liquids (and gases) can be pumped, which means handling is easily mechanized, and thus less laborious.
en-000011445	"First-generation" or conventional biofuels are made from sugar, starch, or vegetable oil.
en-000011446	Ethanol fuel is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly in Brazil.
en-000011447	The ethanol production methods used are enzyme digestion (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, distillation and drying.
en-000011448	Ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage.
en-000011449	Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline.
en-000011450	Corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of cellulosic ethanol.
en-000011451	Ethanol has roughly one-third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline.
en-000011452	With current subsidies, ethanol fuel is slightly cheaper per distance traveled in the United States.
en-000011453	It is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel.
en-000011454	Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters (FAMEs).
en-000011455	Pure biodiesel (B100) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel Second generation B100.
en-000011456	Biodiesel can be used in any diesel engine when mixed with mineral diesel.
en-000011457	B100 may become more viscous at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.
en-000011458	These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel.
en-000011459	It also effectively cleans the engine combustion chamber of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency.
en-000011460	In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.
en-000011461	This improves the combustion of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon.
en-000011462	In the USA, more than 80% of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel.
en-000011463	The emerging US biodiesel market is estimated to have grown 200% from 2004 to 2005.
en-000011464	In France, biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of 8% in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles.
en-000011465	Avril Group produces under the brand Diester, a fifth of 11 million tons of biodiesel consumed annually by the European Union.
en-000011466	Methanol is currently produced from natural gas, a non-renewable fossil fuel.
en-000011467	In the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as biomethanol.
en-000011468	The methanol economy is an alternative to the hydrogen economy, compared to today's hydrogen production from natural gas.
en-000011469	"E. coli" strains have also been successfully engineered to produce butanol by modifying their amino acid metabolism.
en-000011470	Green diesel is produced through hydrocracking biological oil feedstocks, such as vegetable oils and animal fats.
en-000011471	It may also be called renewable diesel, hydrotreated vegetable oil or hydrogen-derived renewable diesel.
en-000011472	This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn.
en-000011473	Oils and fats can be hydrogenated to give a diesel substitute.
en-000011474	Bioethers (also referred to as fuel ethers or oxygenated fuels) are cost-effective compounds that act as octane rating enhancers.
en-000011475	"Bioethers are produced by the reaction of reactive iso-olefins, such as iso-butylene, with bioethanol."
en-000011476	They also enhance engine performance, whilst significantly reducing engine wear and toxic exhaust emissions.
en-000011477	Greatly reducing the amount of ground-level ozone emissions, they contribute to air quality.
en-000011478	Ethers were introduced in Europe in the 1970s to replace the highly toxic compound.
en-000011479	Biogas is methane produced by the process of anaerobic digestion of organic material by anaerobes.
en-000011480	The solid byproduct, digestate, can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer.
en-000011481	Biogas can be recovered from mechanical biological treatment waste processing systems.
en-000011482	Landfill gas, a less clean form of biogas, is produced in landfills through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion.
en-000011483	If it escapes into the atmosphere, it is a potential greenhouse gas.
en-000011484	Farmers can produce biogas from manure from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters.
en-000011485	Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, turbines or high-temperature fuel cells.
en-000011486	The wood gas generator, a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.
en-000011487	Lower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing biochar, but results in syngas polluted with tar.
en-000011488	Examples include wood, sawdust, grass trimmings, domestic refuse, charcoal, agricultural waste, nonfood energy crops, and dried manure.
en-000011489	The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product.
en-000011490	The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.
en-000011491	Utilities generate power, typically in the range of 5 to 50 MW, using locally available fuel.
en-000011492	Other industries have also installed wood waste fueled boilers and dryers in areas with low cost fuel.
en-000011493	In theory, this means fuel and food production do not compete for resources, although this is not always the case.
en-000011494	Even modern pellet boilers generate much more pollutants than oil or natural gas boilers.
en-000011495	Pellets made from agricultural residues are usually worse than wood pellets, producing much larger emissions of dioxins and chlorophenols.
en-000011496	To compensate for this, more fossil fuel must be procured and consumed to make up for lost capacity.
en-000011497	Firing biomass instead of coal led to a 148% reduction in GWP.
en-000011498	A derivative of solid biofuel is biochar, which is produced by biomass pyrolysis.
en-000011499	Second generation biofuels, also known as advanced biofuels, are fuels that can be manufactured from various types of biomass.
en-000011500	Biomass is a wide-ranging term meaning any source of organic carbon that is renewed rapidly as part of the carbon cycle.
en-000011501	Biomass is derived from plant materials but can also include animal materials.
en-000011502	A series of physical and chemical treatments might be required to convert lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels suitable for transportation.
en-000011503	Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.
en-000011504	A key consideration is the minimisation of biofuel competition for prime cropland.
en-000011505	The UN International Biofuels Forum is formed by Brazil, China, India, Pakistan, South Africa, the United States and the European Commission.
en-000011506	The world leaders in biofuel development and use are Brazil, the United States, France, Sweden and Germany.
en-000011507	Russia also has 22% of world's forest, and is a big biomass (solid biofuels) supplier.
en-000011508	The plant will eventually produce about 900,000 tons of pellets per year, making it the largest in the world once operational.
en-000011509	Biofuels currently make up 3.1% of the total road transport fuel in the UK or 1,440 million litres.
en-000011510	The WHO estimates 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 due to air pollution.
en-000011511	According to one estimate, air pollution is killing 1.6 million Chinese per year.
en-000011512	Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.
en-000011513	Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops.
en-000011514	A group of Spanish developers working for a company called Ecofasa announced a new biofuel made from trash.
en-000011515	As the primary source of biofuels in North America, many organizations are conducting research in the area of ethanol production.
en-000011516	On the federal level, the USDA conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the United States.
en-000011517	Much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets.
en-000011518	Cellulosic ethanol commercialization is the process of building an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel.
en-000011519	Companies, such as Iogen, POET, and Abengoa, are building refineries that can process biomass and turn it into bioethanol.
en-000011520	Companies, such as Diversa, Novozymes, and Dyadic, are producing enzymes that could enable a cellulosic ethanol future.
en-000011521	As of 2013, the first commercial-scale plants to produce cellulosic biofuels have begun operating.
en-000011522	Multiple pathways for the conversion of different biofuel feedstocks are being used.
en-000011523	Lessons learnt will lower the costs of the industrial processes involved.
en-000011524	From 1978 to 1996, the US NREL experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the "Aquatic Species Program".
en-000011525	Many companies are pursuing algae bioreactors for various purposes, including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels.
en-000011526	Successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase jatropha farm production yields by 200-300% in the next 10 years.
en-000011527	More research on this fungal species, "Cunninghamella""japonica", and others, is likely to appear in the near future.
en-000011528	Microbial gastrointestinal flora in a variety of animals have shown potential for the production of biofuels.
en-000011529	Microbes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating biofuels from bamboo and other plant materials.
en-000011530	This region is composed of 15% Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity, and 80% Cerrado forest with lower biodiversity.
en-000011531	This has to do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves.
en-000011532	Biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on abandoned agricultural lands incur little to no carbon debt.
en-000011533	In addition to water required to grow crops, biofuel facilities require significant process water.
en-000011534	Crash test dummies remain indispensable in the development of and ergonomics in all types of vehicles, from automobiles to aircraft.
en-000011535	There are many specialized dummies used for obesity, children, rib impact, and spinal impact.
en-000011536	THOR is a very advanced dummy because it uses sensors and has a humanlike spine and pelvis.
en-000011537	There are studies that use specific cadavers including obese cadavers, and children cadavers.
en-000011538	Ward, of Parsonstown, Ireland, was thrown out of a motor vehicle and killed.
en-000011539	Since then, over 20 million people worldwide have died due to motor vehicle accidents.
en-000011540	Death rates had surpassed 15.6 fatalities per 100 million vehicle-miles and were continuing to climb.
en-000011541	In 1930 cars had dashboards of rigid metal, non-collapsible steering columns, and protruding knobs, buttons, and levers.
en-000011542	Without seat belts, passengers in a frontal collision could be hurled against the interior of the automobile or through the windshield.
en-000011543	The vehicle body itself was rigid, and impact forces were transmitted directly to the vehicle occupants.
en-000011544	It was therefore necessary to employ two types of test subjects in order to develop initial data sets.
en-000011545	Cadavers fitted with crude accelerometers were strapped into automobiles and subjected to head-on collisions and vehicle rollovers.
en-000011546	King's calculations indicate that as a result of design changes implemented up to 1987, cadaver research since saved 8,500 lives annually.
en-000011547	However, work with cadavers presented almost as many problems as it resolved.
en-000011548	Not only were there the moral and ethical issues related to working with the dead, but there were also research concerns.
en-000011549	In addition, child cadavers were not only difficult to obtain, but both legal and public opinion made them effectively unusable.
en-000011550	In addition, they have divided Australian public opinion unnecessarily on the vital issue of the country’s security.
en-000011551	Moreover, as crash testing became more routine, suitable cadavers became increasingly scarce.
en-000011552	As a result, biometric data were limited in extent and skewed toward the older males.
en-000011553	The researchers also suggested that an obese person could be protected by their fat almost causing a "cushioning effect."
en-000011554	NDTs provided detailed observations and allowed researchers to look at a specific area of the brain after the crash stimulation.
en-000011555	To measure neck injuries for three year olds, the model FE was created.
en-000011556	A real child's neck was interpreted and incorporated into the FE model.
en-000011557	There are only a few FE models and they were mostly utilized through sled tests.
en-000011558	Some researchers took it upon themselves to serve as crash test dummies.
en-000011559	Colonel John Paul Stapp USAF propelled himself over 1000 km/h on a rocket sled and stopped in 1.4 seconds.
en-000011560	To gather information about the causes and prevention of injuries and fatalities would require a different kind of subject.
en-000011561	By the mid-1950s, the bulk of the information cadaver testing could provide had been harvested.
en-000011562	It was also necessary to collect data on accident survivability, research for which cadavers were woefully inadequate.
en-000011563	In concert with the shortage of cadavers, this need forced researchers to seek other models.
en-000011564	The most commonly used animal subjects in cabin-collision studies were pigs, primarily because their internal structure is similar to a human's.
en-000011565	Pigs can also be placed in a vehicle in a good approximation of a seated human.
en-000011566	In 1980, the use of animals such as bears and pigs were tested in car stimulation crashes.
en-000011567	This led to moral dilemmas and was not the first time that animals were used in car crashes.
en-000011568	The University of Michigan's mission was to create safer cars for human use.
en-000011569	In order to reach this goal, research and testing is inevitable.
en-000011570	The cruelty and the moral dilemmas of animal testing did not trump researchers still using them as subjects.
en-000011571	They reasoned that biomechanics data is needed for an experiment like this, which will lead to safer cars.
en-000011572	Years later animal testing ceased and instead an instrumental dummy was created for replacement.
en-000011573	In 1978, animals were their only source of subject that would be a reliable substitution to the human being.
en-000011574	This testing involved the use of high acceleration to 1000 km/h (600 mph) rocket sleds, beyond the capability of human volunteers to tolerate.
en-000011575	The original "Sierra Sam" was a 95th percentile male dummy (heavier and taller than 95% of human males).
en-000011576	Sierra followed up with a competitor dummy, a model it called "Sierra Stan".
en-000011577	Hybrid I was what is known as a "50th percentile male" dummy.
en-000011578	That is to say, it modeled an average male in height, mass, and proportion.
en-000011579	Since then, considerable work has gone into creating more and more sophisticated dummies.
en-000011580	Hybrid II was introduced in 1972, with improved shoulder, spine, and knee responses, and more rigorous documentation.
en-000011581	A dummy was needed which would allow researchers to explore injury-reduction strategies.
en-000011582	If he could stand upright, he would be 175 cm (5'9") tall and would have a mass of 77 kg (170 lb).
en-000011583	He occupies the driver's seat in all the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) 65 km/h (40 mph) offset frontal crash tests.
en-000011584	He is joined by a "big brother", the 95th percentile Hybrid III, at 188 cm (6 ft 2 in) and 100 kg (223 lb).
en-000011585	Hybrid III is a 5th percentile female dummy, at a diminutive 152 cm (5 ft) tall and 50 kg (110 lb).
en-000011586	The three Hybrid III child dummies represent a ten-year-old, 21 kg (47 lb) six-year-old, and a 15 kg (33 lb) three-year-old.
en-000011587	When using data from the real world, the results did not match up to the hybrid III stimulation injuries.
en-000011588	To get around this, THUMS was created which stands for Total Human Model of Safety.
en-000011589	The model can be easily relatable to the human body anatomically especially focusing on the human spine upon impact.
en-000011590	Clinical testing and experiments are more accurate than a dummy and more reliable case studies can be implemented with this model.
en-000011591	The model is based on a male only, and mimics human tissues and organs.
en-000011592	Instead, the FE model can be appropriately implemented for this criteria.
en-000011593	Its head is removed and is dropped from 40 centimetres to test calibrate the head instrumentation.
en-000011594	Then the head and neck are reattached, set in motion, and stopped abruptly to check for proper neck flexure.
en-000011595	Hybrids wear chamois leather skin; the knees are struck with a metal probe to check for proper puncture.
en-000011596	Recorded in a temporary data repository in the dummy's chest, these data are downloaded to computer once the test is complete.
en-000011597	Because the Hybrid is a standardized data collection device, any part of a particular Hybrid type is interchangeable with any other.
en-000011598	In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age.
en-000011599	A study was done on restraints and positioning of three year olds.
en-000011600	The safety results indicated that children should be placed in the back seat and restrained.
en-000011601	It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than seating positions.
en-000011602	This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight, height.
en-000011603	After head-on collisions, the most common severe injury accident is the side impact.
en-000011604	This family is composed of four species in one genus, "Pardalotus", and several subspecies.
en-000011605	The family once contained several other species now split into the family Acanthizidae.
en-000011606	Their role in controlling lerp infestations in the eucalyptus forests of Australia may be significant.
en-000011607	They generally live in pairs or small family groups but sometimes come together into flocks after breeding.
en-000011608	Pardalotes are seasonal breeders in temperate areas of Australia but may breed year round in warmer areas.
en-000011609	They are monogamous breeders, and both partners share nest construction, incubation and chick-rearing duties.
en-000011610	All four species nest in deep horizontal tunnels drilled into banks of earth.
en-000011611	Externally about the size of a mouse-hole, they can be very deep, at a metre or more.
en-000011612	The pardalotes consist of several species contained in a single genus, "Pardalotus", with the general consensus being to recognise four species.
en-000011613	In addition both groups have a reduced tenth primary (one of the flight feathers).
en-000011614	The striated pardalote contains six subspecies, which are sometimes elevated to four separate species.
en-000011615	The spotted and striated pardalotes conform to Bergmann's rule and are larger in the south than they are in the north.
en-000011616	Today, the South’s GDP is 40 times larger than that of the North.
en-000011617	They have short, square-tipped tails and relatively short rounded wings (which are longer in the more dispersive species).
en-000011618	The bill is short, deep and robust, but lacks the rictal bristles that surround the bills of many other insectivorous birds.
en-000011619	Pardalotes forage by gleaning insects from the foliage, as opposed to sallying and catching insects in the air.
en-000011620	These lerps are also highly sought after by the larger honeyeaters, which aggressively defend the resource.
en-000011621	A study of pardalotes in Australia estimated that 5% of a pardalote's day is spent evading honeyeater attacks.
en-000011622	The party's stronghold is around Luxembourg City; it has provided the city's Mayor since 1970.
en-000011623	The party has often played the minor coalition partner to the Christian Social People's Party (CSV).
en-000011624	The party is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) and Liberal International.
en-000011625	At the time of its foundation, the party had six seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
en-000011626	This political upset gave it the opportunity to enter into coalition negotiations with the second-placed LSAP.
en-000011627	When PM, in 1975, Thorn sat as President of the United Nations General Assembly.
en-000011628	In 1979, Thorn went head-to-head with Werner, with the LSAP serving a supporting role to the DP.
en-000011629	As a result, Werner formed a coalition with the DP, with Thorn as Deputy Prime Minister.
en-000011630	In the first European election in 1979, the DP won 2 seats: an achievement that it hasn't matched since.
en-000011631	In 1980, Thorn was named the new President of the European Commission, and was replaced by Colette Flesch.
en-000011632	The 1984 general election saw the DP's first electoral setback in twenty years.
en-000011633	The LSAP formed a coalition with the CSV, with Jacques Poos serving as Deputy Prime Minister to Jacques Santer.
en-000011634	This was renewed twice again, and the DP remained out of government until 1999.
en-000011635	After the 1999 general election, the DP became the second-largest party in the Chamber of Deputies once again, with 15 seats.
en-000011636	It also overtook the LSAP in vote share for the first time ever.
en-000011637	This allowed it to displace the LSAP as the CSV's coalition partner, with Lydie Polfer as Deputy Prime Minister.
en-000011638	As a result of the 2004 general election, the DP lost 5 seats, bringing its total down to 10.
en-000011639	The party also lost its place as the coalition partner back to the LSAP, and remained in opposition since until 2013.
en-000011640	The Democratic Party sits on the moderate centre-right of the political spectrum in Luxembourg.
en-000011641	It is also a supporter of agriculture, particularly the wine industry.
en-000011642	The DP is the most outspoken party in support of civil liberties.
en-000011643	Between 1974 and 1979, it legalised abortion and divorce, and abolished the death penalty.
en-000011644	It also focuses its attention on the issues of minority groups, particularly migrant groups, but also homosexuals and single mothers.
en-000011645	Unlike the Catholic CSV, the DP is notably anti-clerical, which gives it more importance than its electoral performances would suggest.
en-000011646	It is the most vocal supporter of European integration, even in a particularly pro-EU country.
en-000011647	The party is centrist on national security, supporting membership of NATO, but having worked to end conscription.
en-000011648	The DP has been consistent in its advocacy of the middle class, and consequently has a very distinctive class profile.
en-000011649	When in government, the DP has always held the office of Minister for the Middle Class.
en-000011650	Most DP supporters are civil servants, white-collar workers, self-employed people, and those on high incomes.
en-000011651	This group has been fast-growing, further focusing the party's electoral socio-economic appeal.
en-000011652	Although China is growing fast, its economic power remains tiny.
en-000011653	The party's most successful areas electorally are Luxembourg City and its wealthy suburbs, where those groups are concentrated.
en-000011654	The city lies in the Centre constituency, where the DP challenges the CSV for the most seats.
en-000011655	However, the party also has some traditional following in Est and the Nord, consistently coming second in each.
en-000011656	Unlike the CSV and LSAP, the DP is not affiliated to a major trade union.
en-000011657	Despite its anti-clericalism, DP voters are no less religiously affiliated than the general population.
en-000011658	Timelines showing the number of seats and percentage of votes won are on the right.
en-000011659	Below is a list of Presidents of the Democratic Party, and its predecessors, since 1948.
en-000011660	Heald was born in Reading, Berkshire, and was educated at the Reading School and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he read Law.
en-000011661	He became the Chairman of the North Hertfordshire Conservative Association for two years from 1984.
en-000011662	He held the seat with a majority of 16,531 and has remained an MP since.
en-000011663	Conservatives held a majority of the seats in Scotland less than 60 years ago.
en-000011664	In Parliament he served on the Education Select Committee for two years from 1992.
en-000011665	Later in the year he became the PPS to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, William Waldegrave.
en-000011666	He was made a Spokesman for Health by Iain Duncan Smith in 2001.
en-000011667	He joined his Shadow Cabinet as the Shadow Leader of the House of Commons in 2003.
en-000011668	In July 2007 he became a backbencher following 13 years'continuous service on the Conservative Front Bench.
en-000011669	However, he did not actually vote for or against the Bill which probably helped his chances of promotion.
en-000011670	Heald became the Executive Chairman of the Society of Conservative Lawyers in July 2008.
en-000011671	The President of Senegal is the head of state of Senegal.
en-000011672	The following is a list of Presidents of Senegal, since the country gained independence from France in 1960.
en-000011673	And while about 100 developing countries gained independence, the process was not always peaceful.
en-000011674	This group is distinct for its more traditional, strongly subsistence based economy which includes reindeer husbandry.
en-000011675	Komi-Permyaks (125,235 people) live in Perm Krai and Kirov Oblast of Russia.
en-000011676	The name for the northern Komis– Zyrians– has a more contradictory origin.
en-000011677	The name Komi is the endonym for all groups of the people.
en-000011678	Komi people are divided into two main groups and several smaller subgroups.
en-000011679	The Komi have been traditionally named after the rivers where they live:
en-000011680	The Komi language belongs to the Permian branch of the Uralic family.
en-000011681	Cyrillic was used from the 19th century and briefly replaced by the Latin alphabet between 1929 and 1933.
en-000011682	The first book to be printed in Komi (a vaccination manual) appeared in 1815.
en-000011683	Most Komis belong to the Russian Orthodox Church, but their religion often contains traces of pre-Christian beliefs (see Komi mythology).
en-000011684	From the 12th century the Russians began to expand into the Perm region and the Komis came into contact with Novgorod.
en-000011685	Novgorodian traders travelled to the region in search of furs and animal hides.
en-000011686	The Novgorodians referred to the southern Komi region as "the Great Perm".
en-000011687	Komi dukes unified the Great Perm with its centre at the stronghold of Cherdyn.
en-000011688	As the Middle Ages progressed, Novgorod gave way to Moscow as the leading Russian power in the region.
en-000011689	Mikhail's conversion failed to stop an attack by Moscow which seized Cherdyn in 1472.
en-000011690	Mikhail was allowed to keep his title of duke but was now a vassal of Moscow.
en-000011691	Syktyvkar ("Ust-Sysolsk" before 1930) was founded as the chief Russian city in the region in the 18th century.
en-000011692	The Russian government established penal settlements in the north for criminals and political prisoners.
en-000011693	In 1986, the government released political prisoners – a precondition for talks with the opposition.
en-000011694	Russian rule in the area collapsed after World War I and the revolutions of 1917.
en-000011695	In the subsequent Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks fought the Allies for control of the region.
en-000011696	They promoted Komi culture but increased industrialisation damaged the Komis'traditional way of life.
en-000011697	Stalin's purges of the 1930s devastated the Komi intelligentsia, who were accused of "bourgeois nationalism".
en-000011698	The remote and inhospitable region was also regarded as an ideal location for the prison camps of the Gulag.
en-000011699	Since the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Komis have reasserted their claims to a separate identity.
en-000011700	A study on north-eastern populations, published in March 2013, found that Komi peoples form a distinct pole of genetic diversity.
en-000011701	To its south it has a coastline of around 45 km on the Gulf of Thailand.
en-000011702	It is rich in low arable lands and has abundant natural resources.
en-000011703	Natural resources were abundant in the North, and even electricity was supplied from North to South.
en-000011704	The "Circonscription Résidentielle de Kampot" contained the arrondissements of Kampot, Kompong-Som, Trang and Kong-Pisey.
en-000011705	Nearby was also a Vietnamese village, called Tien-Thanh and another Vietnamese village on Traeuy Koh Island.
en-000011706	Dhule is a city and a municipal corporation in Dhule District in the northwestern part of Maharashtra state, India.
en-000011707	It is one of the very few well-planned cities in India.
en-000011708	Dhule is widely known across the country for its architecture and urban design.
en-000011709	The town planning of this city was done by Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya.

en-000011892	But, most importantly, the invention of coins greatly enhanced the spread of knowledge.
en-000011893	The phonograph allowed the speech signal to be recorded and then later processed and analyzed.
en-000011894	Further advances in acoustic phonetics were made possible by the development of the telephone industry.

en-000011904	By the end of 1977, Metro had pushed the opening of the Green Line to June 1983.
en-000011905	Nonetheless, Metro reiterated that it intended to complete the extension to Anacostia station by late 1983.
en-000011906	By now, Anacostia residents were increasingly angry at the repeated delays in building the Green Line.
en-000011907	In October 1980, "The Washington Post" ran a major article asking "What Ever Happened to the Green Line?"
en-000011908	In late 1978 and 1979, a controversy erupted over parking at the planned station.
en-000011909	In 1978, Metro proposed building a 2,000-space parking lot on the west side of the Anacostia Freeway.
en-000011910	But residents resisted this plan as well on the grounds that too much traffic would clog local streets.
en-000011911	In January 1981, Metro admitted that the station would not open until 1990 because of funding constraints.
en-000011912	In May 1981, Metro changed its estimate for the opening of the Anacostia station to early 1988.
en-000011913	Metro estimated on December 9, 1981, that the Anacostia station would open in late 1989.
en-000011914	Construction of the Anacostia station was also delayed by a land controversy involving the federal government.
en-000011915	Because the nursery was on federally owned land, moving it required an Act of Congress.
en-000011916	Metro proposed moving the nursery to Camp Simms, a former U.S. Army campground in the Congress Heights neighborhood.
en-000011917	The United States House of Representatives and United States Senate passed legislation approving the move in March and June 1984, respectively.
en-000011918	But even as the nursery resiting issue was resolved, funding problems delayed construction on the station.
en-000011919	More cuts in federal construction funds for Metro further delayed construction of the Anacostia station.
en-000011920	Metro announced in December 1982 that the station would not open until late 1989 at the earliest.
en-000011921	More than 23,000 Anacostia residents signed a public petition demanding that the line be built.
en-000011922	The U.S. federal district court approved the agreement on March 7.
en-000011923	Metro also began new political efforts to secure funding to complete the transit system.
en-000011924	Survey and clearing work for the twin 2,500-foot (762 m) Anacostia River tunnels began in March 1985.
en-000011925	The completion date for the two tunnels was estimated at late 1987.
en-000011926	A major controversy over parking at the Anacostia station occurred as well.
en-000011927	In May 1985, Metro officials still maintained that construction on the parking garage would begin in June.
en-000011928	The bid was more than $1.6 million higher than the rejected second-round bid.
en-000011929	Construction on the three-level parking structure was well under way by April 1986.
en-000011930	A significant number of prehistoric artifacts were found during the station's excavation.
en-000011931	Exit 3B (Howard Road) on southbound I-295 was closed to construct Anacostia station, blocking traffic from reaching South Capitol Street.
en-000011932	On March 23, 1986, the second of the two 2,450-foot (747.25 m), concrete-lined tunnels under the Anacostia River was completed.
en-000011933	In December 1988, Metro reaffirmed that the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations would open in late 1991.
en-000011934	The cost of testing and operating the Green Line left Metro struggling financially.
en-000011935	The Mount Vernon-UDC, Shaw, and U Street-Cardozo stations opened in May 1991.
en-000011936	Metro announced on September 6, 1991, that the Green Line from L'Enfant Plaza to Anacostia would open on December 28, 1991.
en-000011937	Only 983 parking spaces would be available at the station upon its opening (673 of them in the parking garage).
en-000011938	One hundred and fifty Anacostia residents rode a special preview train along the line on December 21.
en-000011939	The Green Line from L'Enfant Plaza to Anacostia opened on schedule at 8:00 AM on December 28.
en-000011940	The $286 million extension added 2.88 miles (4.63 km) to the rail system.
en-000011941	Metro estimated 20,000 riders a day would board at Anacostia station alone by late June 1992.
en-000011942	Metro said 1,854 people boarded at Anacostia, 459 boarded at Waterfront, and 127 boarded at Navy Yard on the first workday.
en-000011943	By March 1992, the number of weekday riders had risen to nearly 11,000 per day at Anacostia station alone.
en-000011944	Only an average of 275 people parked each day at the station's parking garage and parking lot by March 1992.
en-000011945	To encourage parking, in April 1992 Metro offered half-price parking coupons to encourage commuters to use the Anacostia parking spaces.
en-000011946	Metro also held public hearings in Maryland to learn why commuters did not use the lot; crime was the highest concern.
en-000011947	The campaign worked, and by November 1992 the lot was nearly full every weekday.
en-000011948	The Green Line's final five stations opened on January 13, 2001.
en-000011949	Like all Metro stations, the Anacostia station was intended to be a major hub for Metrobus service in its area.
en-000011950	A total of 25 routes were changed, affecting more than 80,000 riders.
en-000011951	District residents protested the cuts with a picket line in front of Metro's downtown headquarters in late August 1991.
en-000011952	Metro officials were angered by Dixon's statement, saying District officials had been involved in the bus route planning process for months.
en-000011953	The District of Columbia had spent more than $20 million adding bus bays at the station to accommodate The Bus arrivals.
en-000011954	The compromise led residents to call off their boycott of Metrobus.
en-000011955	In November 1992, Metro reported that ridership at the Anacostia station was (on average) 7,500 riders a day, 700 below estimates.
en-000011956	Metro also encountered controversy over its plan to upgrade the conditions of the buses in the Anacostia area.
en-000011957	In retaliation, D.C.'s representatives on Metro's board of directors vetoed funding for 16 of Metro's projects.
en-000011958	The Anacostia station has had relatively few maintenance issues during its lifetime.
en-000011959	In 1997, the station's escalators suffered repeated breakdown, as did escalators throughout the Metrorail system, due to poor maintenance.
en-000011960	Parking at the station was originally difficult to find, but availability has improved over time.
en-000011961	By July 1997, the parking garage at the Anacostia station was usually full by 9 A.M. on a weekday.
en-000011962	But after the Green Line's final five stations opened in January 2001, the parking garage at the Anacostia station became underused.
en-000011963	Its parking garage still did not fill up on workdays as of March 2005.
en-000011964	The Anacostia station has been used several times for experiments in improving Metrorail's operations.
en-000011965	In March 1999, Metro tested a new emergency call box system at Anacostia and two other Metrorail stations.
en-000011966	Technical problems and funding issues delayed implementation of the project on a wider scale.
en-000011967	The express lane program was canceled when too few riders used the express lanes.
en-000011968	Anacostia was also one of eight Metro stations which first sold SmarTrip cards in 2008.
en-000011969	In December 1991, when the Anacostia Station opened, Metro had revised that number to 30,700 riders per day (by June 1992).
en-000011970	Just a week later, Metro dropped that estimate to only 28,000 riders a day (by June 1992).
en-000011971	Metro had estimated that 18,000 riders a day would board from these stations by June 2001.
en-000011972	That estimate was exceeded by 2,000 riders a day on the second day the stations were open.
en-000011973	By January 24, the number had risen to more than 30,600 per day—three times as many as originally estimated.
en-000011974	Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints.
en-000011975	The first reported incident of crime at the Anacostia station occurred during the station's construction.
en-000011976	The first reported crime at Anacostia station occurred on February 5, 1992, just six weeks after the station opened.
en-000011977	Nearly half the arrests occurred at just five stations: Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place-Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue.
en-000011978	Crime continued to be a problem at the Anacostia station late into the first decade of the 21st century.
en-000011979	Assaults and shootings were more frequent at the station than at any other station in the transit system.
en-000011980	To help deter crime, Metro installed outdoor security cameras at the 10 high-crime Metrorail stations in July 2008.
en-000011981	But crime on Metro as a whole was rising in the late 2000s.
en-000011982	Historically, Metro has had a significantly lower crime rate than any comparable transit system in the United States.
en-000011983	But crime on the transit system began spiking in 2008 and 2009.
en-000011984	Metrorail has often been viewed as an important factor in spurring economic development in the D.C. metropolitan region.
en-000011985	As early as 1981, consultants and studies were predicting that the Anacostia station would spark a similar economic revival in Anacostia.
en-000011986	But little real estate speculation in the area had occurred as of mid-1982.
en-000011987	Dr. McGrath and others warned that the city was moving too fast and allowing economic development to get out of control.
en-000011988	In 1999, D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams again made development of Poplar Point a major focus of the District government.
en-000011989	D.C. representatives on Metro's board of directors pushed the agency to accept the proposal in April 2007.
en-000011990	Metro's efforts to develop the land at the Anacostia station have been strongly criticized.
en-000011991	By 2007, Metro had signed 56 joint development projects generating $129 million (over 30 years) in income.
en-000011992	Credibility is also enhanced by joint projects such as the development of regional ballistic missile defense.
en-000011993	At least one study showed that Metro-sponsored developments significantly outperformed developments built solely by the private sector.
en-000011994	"Metro has been totally ineffective and counterproductive to any decent development at Metro stations," the task force chairman said.
en-000011995	The report concluded that Metro had actually hindered development near Metrorail stations.
en-000011996	Dozens of proposals had been stymied, and development proposals had dropped to an extremely low 2.1 per station per year.
en-000011997	The last publicly reported development proposal at the Anacostia station came in September 2008.
en-000011998	For an investment to be worthwhile, the expected return on capital has to be higher than the cost of capital.
en-000011999	This WACC can then be used as a discount rate for a project's projected free cash flows to firm.
en-000012000	When companies borrow funds from outside lenders, the interest paid on these funds is called the cost of debt.
en-000012001	Thus, for profitable firms, debt is discounted by the tax rate.
en-000012002	where formula_2 is the corporate tax rate and formula_3 is the risk free rate.
en-000012003	Most countries that reduced their corporate-tax rates have followed this path, while the US has done the opposite.
en-000012004	The cost of equity is "inferred" by comparing the investment to other investments (comparable) with similar risk profiles.
en-000012005	It is commonly computed using the capital asset pricing model formula:
en-000012006	The risk free rate is the yield on long term bonds in the particular market, such as government bonds.
en-000012007	The expected return (or required rate of return for investors) can be calculated with the "dividend capitalization model", which is
en-000012008	The equity market real capital gain return has been about the same as annual real GDP growth.
en-000012009	Since 2003, the market has posted a compound annual growth rate of over 110%.
en-000012010	The capital gains on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have been 1.6% per year over the period 1910-2005.
en-000012011	The dividends have increased the total "real" return on average equity to the double, about 3.2%.
en-000012012	The Weighted Cost of Capital (WACC) is used in finance to measure a firm's cost of capital.
en-000012013	Calculation of WACC is an iterative procedure which requires estimation of the fair market value of equity capital.
en-000012014	At some point, however, the cost of issuing new debt will be greater than the cost of issuing new equity.
en-000012015	The Thomson Financial league tables show that global debt issuance exceeds equity issuance with a 90 to 10 margin.
en-000012016	The structure of capital should be determined considering the weighted average cost of capital.

en-000012036	The head office is located in Northcliffe House in Kensington, London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
en-000012037	He was elected as President of Brazil in 1985, but died before he took office.
en-000012038	He received the majority of votes and became President of the Municipal Legislature.
en-000012039	He was elected state representative (1947-1950) and congressman (1951-1953) as a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD).
en-000012040	In 1954 Tancredo was elected congressman and served for one year.
en-000012041	From 1958 to 1960 he headed the Department of Finance of Minas Gerais.
en-000012042	He was later re-elected congressman various times between 1963 and 1979.
en-000012043	In 1984, Tancredo ran for president with the help of Ulysses Guimarães.
en-000012044	He was elected President of Brazil on January 15, 1985 by the indirect voting of an electoral college.
en-000012045	Tancredo fell gravely ill on the eve of his inauguration, March 14, 1985, and died 39 days afterwards.
en-000012046	He died of diverticulitis and never assumed his position as president.
en-000012047	Tancredo Neves was a descendant of Amador Bueno, a noted paulista from the colonial Brazilian era.
en-000012048	His parents were Francisco de Paula Neves and Antonina de Almeida Neves.
en-000012049	After having completed studies in his hometown, he moved to Belo Horizonte and enrolled in Law School.
en-000012050	Three years later he became a representative of his state in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.
en-000012051	In 1953 he was appointed by President Getúlio Vargas to be the Minister of Justice.
en-000012052	Neves served in that post until Vargas committed suicide in 1954.
en-000012053	Tancredo was married to Risoleta Guimarães Tolentino and they had three children.
en-000012054	He received a Doctor's Honorary Degree from the University of Coimbra, and was called“Doctor Tancredo” by his close colleagues.
en-000012055	He is the grandfather of Aécio Neves, who was Minas Gerais'Governor between 2003 and 2010 and is currently senator.
en-000012056	During the Old Republic, Tancredo made opposition to Artur Bernardes, president of Brazil.
en-000012057	He was launched into politics through the municipal political leader Augusto Viegas, to whom he remained grateful.
en-000012058	Later, when the“Progressive Party” was extinct, he joined the“Mineiro Nationalist Party”.
en-000012059	He also worked as an entrepreneur in the textile sector for some time.
en-000012060	With that, the political framework that had been erected under auspicious democrats saw a new political college emerge.
en-000012061	He governed until Getúlio Vargas was deposed on October 29, 1945.
en-000012062	The Assembly would then proclaim the new Constitution on September 18, 1946.
en-000012063	Tancredo Neves was elected congressman in 1950, and Juscelino Kubitschek was elected Governor of Minas Gerais, defeating situationist Gabriel Passos.
en-000012064	Tancredo left the parliamentary mandate and started serving as Minister of Justice on June 26, 1953.
en-000012065	During his office, two laws were sanctioned, the "Press Law," Law 2.083 in 1953 and Law 2.252 on statutory rape.
en-000012066	As Minister of Justice, he opened the investigations of several cases of torture and exploitation of minors.
en-000012067	He closed the "Service of Assistance to Minors" (SAM) after journalist Villas-Boas Corrêa's denunciation.
en-000012068	He visited the location with the journalist in the middle of the night.
en-000012069	Without hesitation, the very next day, Tancredo ordered the place to be closed for investigations and renovation.
en-000012070	He resigned as minister after Getúlio Vargas'suicide on August 24, 1954, twenty days after the assault against journalist Carlos Lacerda.
en-000012071	Benedito Valadares, Juscelino Kubitschek and Getúlio Vargas were Tancredo’s main mentors in politics.
en-000012072	Because he had not left his post in Getúlio's ministry, Tancredo did not run for re-election as congressman in October, 1954.
en-000012073	He was nominated President of "Credit Bank of Minas Gerais" by Governor Clóvis Salgado da Gama.
en-000012074	On August 25, 1961, Tancredo pronounced the installation of parliamentarism; therefore, preventing João Goulart from assuming presidency under a Military Coup.
en-000012075	So, with the developing negotiations, a constitutional amendment was presented, that would convert the presidencialist regime to a parliamentary one.
en-000012076	This change greatly reduced the President's power, and was considered satisfactory by the military officers.
en-000012077	As the efficacy of military power is reduced, so the importance of economic power grows.
en-000012078	The amendment was approved by Congress on the 2nd and opened way to Goulart's return, assuming the presidency on September 7.
en-000012079	Ademar suggested Congressman from the state of Goiânia, Alfredo Nasser, who accepted and assumed post, replacing Tancredo.
en-000012080	It defended the practice of periodical salary adjustments that were compatible with the expanding inflation indexes.
en-000012081	The program complimented“Operation Pan-American” and pastoral pontifical Mater et Magistra.
en-000012082	It approved the agrarian reform“as an essential first step towards the integration of countrymen into our economic life”.
en-000012083	And it proclaimed to be identified with an open-door policy towards foreign capital.
en-000012084	However, the peoples'dissatisfaction continued to grow and their protests against high inflation and for larger salary adjustments, multiplied.
en-000012085	The continuous dead-lock labor negotiations resulted in an explosion of successive strikes.
en-000012086	And a month later, the Department of Agriculture presented its own project.
en-000012087	Meanwhile, social tension was increasing in the interior, especially in the Northeast region.
en-000012088	On June 6 the cabinet, including the prime-minister, resigned in mass.
en-000012089	During his term as congressman, Tancredo claimed to have had partial success in his goal of pacifying the national political mood.
en-000012090	Being a moderate objector of the Military Regime of 1964, Tancredo soon sought shelter in the“Brazilian Democratic Movement” (DMB).
en-000012091	During his parliamentary performance, he tried hard to avoid conflicts with the military government, and was part of MDB’s moderate wing.
en-000012092	That showed a posture that was contrary to the one the MDB’s“authentic” wing had.
en-000012093	Tancredo founded the“Popular Party” in 1980 and was elected as its president.
en-000012094	His running mate and Vice Governor, Hélio Garcia, gave him the support that was fundamental to his election.
en-000012095	Garcia was very knowledgeable about the small counties in Minas Gerais, which Tancredo used to call“grotões”.
en-000012096	That favored the PDS, since it was a strong party in the small counties of Minas Gerais.
en-000012097	Tancredo maintained his conciliatory stance even when in executive office, which guaranteed a good standing with the Federal Government.
en-000012098	On March 15, 1983, the elected governors took office, and debates around President João Figueiredo’s succession began.
en-000012099	The lack of a consensus by the PDS in appointing a name demoted cracks in the governmental college.
en-000012100	Vice-president Aureliano Chaves immediately started having conflicts with President Figueiredo, and that only complicated the process of succession.
en-000012101	Other segments of the military regime opposition acted differently, and included the re-institution of direct presidential elections in their agenda.
en-000012102	They were frustrated with the rejection of the constitutional amendment from April 25, 1984, called Dantes de Oliveira.
en-000012103	Many other commissions were formed between January and April, 1984 and were given the name“Direct-Now Campaign”.
en-000012104	His proposal was quickly repelled by the“malufistas” who interpreted it as a way to derail the leader’s candidacy.
en-000012105	This fact led Sarney to leave the PDS presidency and to abandon his party a few days afterwards.
en-000012106	He was later followed by Jorge Bornhausen, who also left the party.
en-000012107	In contrast, Aureliano Chaves and Marco Maciel were removed from the dispute, which left Paulo Maluf and Mário Andreazza as candidates.
en-000012108	Tancredo secretly wanted businessman Antônio Ermírio de Moraes to be vice-president.
en-000012109	Ermírio de Moraes, born in a traditional family from Pernambuco, was business leader in São Paulo.
en-000012110	His secret was revealed and the possibility of Antônio becoming vice-president was discarded in São Paulo.
en-000012111	Aureliano was also ineligible for vice-president because at the time, re-election was not allowed.
en-000012112	Tancredo was cast as candidate for having approval by the military and for being considered a moderate.
en-000012113	In the military arena, the support that former President Ernesto Geisel offered was very decisive.
en-000012114	But, Tancredo’s moderation was a target of criticism by the Workers'Party (Brazil) (PT), who did not accept the Electoral college.
en-000012115	Minas Gerais belonged to the SUDENE because its North region was part of the drought area known as“Drought Polygon”.
en-000012116	Many of these governors moved to the“Liberal Front” that later became the Liberal Front Party Democrats(Brazil) (PFL).
en-000012117	Among Tancredo’s admirers, was former Governor of Bahia, Antônio Carlos Magalhães.
en-000012118	In response, Antônio Carlos accused Délio Jardim of being such traitor.
en-000012119	This was the first time that a minister form the military had been challenged during the Military Regime.
en-000012120	The Baiano leader, Antônio Carlos, then added:“To betray the Revolution of 1964 is to support Maluf for president”.
en-000012121	Even though they were indirect elections, Tancredo still did many rallies in public places.
en-000012122	The Military Regime ended in 1985 after João Figueiredo’s administration was over.
en-000012123	The expression“New Republic” became the way in which the period after 1985 became known in Brazilian politics.
en-000012124	Tancredo Neves who was being hailed as“a conciliation candidate”, was elected president by the Electoral College in 1985.
en-000012125	He received 480 votes while Maluf received 180 votes and there were 26 abstentions.
en-000012126	The majority of these abstentions came from parliamentarians from the Workers'Party (Brazil) (PT).
en-000012127	They disobeyed the guidance given by their party and were then removed from it for having voted in Tancredo Neves.
en-000012128	Congressmen Aírton Soares, José Eudes and Bete Mendes were expelled from the PT.
en-000012129	Let us remain united as we were on public squares, with the same emotion, the same dignity and the same decision.
en-000012130	Soon after, the Workers'Party PT and the Central Única dos Trabalhadores CUT started making opposition to Tancredo.
en-000012131	At the end of 1984 the polls showed that Tancredo had won the majority of the Electoral College.
en-000012132	He only agreed to have surgical operation after several Heads of state had arrived in Brasília for his inauguration.
en-000012133	The meetings with Heads of state were a strategic move by Tancredo to make the process of re-democratization irreversible.
en-000012134	Tancredo’s maneuvers were so successful that they made even Ulysses Guimarães, (referred to as“Mr.
en-000012135	He gathered the support of Congress and state governors, and travelled abroad as the elected president.
en-000012136	He had been suffering strong abdominal pain during the days preceding his inauguration.
en-000012137	Advised by his doctors to seek treatment, he said:“You can do whatever you want with me… after I take office”.
en-000012138	Tancredo feared that the military from the so-called“hardliners” would refuse to give power to the vice-president.
en-000012139	That would have made it harder for a political rupture to occur.
en-000012140	He fell ill in Brasília at the“Dom Bosco Sanctuary” during the religious ceremony, with strong continuous abdominal pain.
en-000012141	The official version of the compilation informed that Tancredo had been a victim of diverticulitis.
en-000012142	But, later reports indicated that he had a benign but infected leiomyoma.
en-000012143	The ceremony for transfer of power took place at the Palácio do Planalto.
en-000012144	It was the official photographer of the palace, Gervézio Batista, who put the ribbon around Sarney’s torso.
en-000012145	There was great tension at the time due to the possibility of the growing democratic opening being interrupted.
en-000012146	In the event of Sarney not taking office, President of Chamber of Deputies, Ulysses Guimarães, would.
en-000012147	Ulysses belonged to the PMDB and was not well accepted by the members of the Military.
en-000012148	During the meeting, Leônidas'interpretation of the 1967 Constitution prevailed, and so, the National Congress decided on Sarney.
en-000012149	“Hospital da Base” in Brasília was undergoing restoration during the time Tancredo had been admitted there, and had demolished its ICU.
en-000012150	The poor hospital environment contributed to complications after his surgery, so Tancredo’s health declined.
en-000012151	He was then transferred to Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo in São Paulo.
en-000012152	Tancredo had seven surgeries during the time he was in the hospital.
en-000012153	He died of a generalized infection on April 21 (same date as Tiradentes's death), at the age of 75.
en-000012154	Tancredo’s death was announced with sadness by the president’s official spokesman, Antônio Britto.
en-000012155	He was also the first politician form the military opposition to be elected president since the Military Coup of 1964.
en-000012156	Brazil followed the Mineiro politician’s agony closely, and organized one of the largest funerals in the country’s history.
en-000012157	A song by Mineiro singer, Milton Nascimento, titled“Coração de Estudante”, marked the episode in the minds of the nation.
en-000012158	It was never engraved on the tombstone that was placed beside the“St.
en-000012159	His burial in São João del Rei was transmitted on national TV.
en-000012160	Ulysses Silveira Guimarães gave a speech before his grave, which was grave number 85 (year he was elected).
en-000012161	In March, 2008, Tancredo’s grave was vandalized and the marble piece from the superior part of the tomb was broken.
en-000012162	He was honored in São João del Rei with the installation of his statue placed next to the statue of Tiradentes.
en-000012163	In 2012, Tancredo’s children requested a Habeas Data from the“Federal Justice” in Brasília.
en-000012164	Although it was benign, the announcement of a tumor could have been interpreted as cancer back then.
en-000012165	That would have caused unpredictable effects on the political development of that time.
en-000012166	The year 2010 was marked by Tancredo’s 100 birthday, so, on March 1 special stamp was created to celebrate it.
en-000012167	This event was part of a series of tributes that took place until his birth date, March 4.
en-000012168	During a tribute to the former President’s 100 birthday in Brasília, his bust was inaugurated in the“Senate Noble Hall”.
en-000012169	He is remembered as“a conciliating and an able political articulator”.
en-000012170	A city in Bahia was named Presidente Tancredo Neves in his celebration.
en-000012171	And, the capital of Bahia, Salvador, has its business and finance centers on Avenida Tancredo Neves.
en-000012172	The Tancredo Neves International Airport in Belo Horizonte is named after him.
en-000012173	He also wrote numerous speeches and opinions that were published in newspapers, magazines and parliamentary annuals.
en-000012174	The first book was written based on an interview he had given his niece, Lucília de Almeida Neves.
en-000012175	A feature film and a biography were made about Tancredo’s life.
en-000012176	The film by João Batista de Andrade was titled“A Céu Aberto”.
en-000012177	In 2011, the documentary titled“Tancredo– The crossing” by Silvio Tendler was released.
en-000012178	In 2010, the book titled“The Patient- the Tancredo Neves Case” by Luís Mir was launched.
en-000012179	The book shows a surgical guide that better explains his surgeries, and has testimonials from the specialists involved.
en-000012180	It is located on the Panteão da Pátria in the Praça dos Três Poderes.
en-000012181	The space features videos, digital media and original documents portraying steps of the period of the re-democratization of Brazil.
en-000012182	The concept of underemployment equilibrium originates from analyzing underemployment in the context of General Equilibrium Theory, a branch of microeconomics.
en-000012183	[3] Exogenous forces such as fiscal policy have to be implemented in order to drive the economy to a better state.
en-000012184	An underemployment equilibrium, given a price vector p, is defined as the consumption-production vector (x^*,y^*) such that[4]
en-000012185	Many factors contribute to the existence of undesirable equilibriums, among which two are crucial for underemployment equilibrium: oversupply and insufficient demand.
en-000012186	When there are many fewer job opportunities than unemployed individuals, the unemployment rate is high.
en-000012187	“Oversupply” here refers to an excess in both labor quantity and quality.
en-000012188	Overqualification is the most common form of underemployment equilibrium and is a direct result of oversupply.
en-000012189	It defines the situation when individuals work in professions which require less education, skill, experience or ability than they possess.
en-000012190	In economic terms, these agents are producing less than their socially optimal output.
en-000012191	In terms of economic output, today’s EU is on par with the US.
en-000012192	Collectively, when a lot of individuals produce below their full potential, the economy is in a sub-optimal underemployment equilibrium.
en-000012193	Overstaffing refers to the state when firms in an economy are hiring more people than they need.
en-000012194	This redundancy invalidates unemployment rates as a signal for the existence of underemployment equilibrium.
en-000012195	During the 1930s, Great Depression, U.S. unemployment rate reached 25% and GDP growth rate fell to −13%.
en-000012196	[7] The U.S. economy at this period can be characterized by an underemployment equilibrium.
en-000012197	On the one hand, many outside forces (including financial instability, hyper-inflation, lack of capital, etc.)
en-000012198	Both of the above forces help create an insufficient demand of labor market during that time, causing an underemployment equilibrium.
en-000012199	This particular underemployment equilibrium takes form of overqualification, characterized by high unemployment rate and low household incomes.
en-000012200	The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates monthly the“Underemployment Rate” starting from January, 1948.
en-000012201	Similar to the unemployment rate, the underemployment rate varies for different subgroups of the labor force.
en-000012202	Erdogan, B.,& Bauer, T. N..“Perceived overqualification and its outcomes: The moderating role of empowerment”.

en-000012205	An academy of sciences is a national academy or another learned society dedicated to sciences.
en-000012206	And, in 1979, the US National Academy of Sciences issued a stark warning of impending global warming.
en-000012207	For example, the Australian Academy of Sciences is an organization of natural scientists, reflecting the English use of the term "scientist".
en-000012208	The Hungarian "Academy of Science" ("Magyar Tudományos Akadémia"), however, has members from many other areas of academia.
en-000012209	Academies of science play an important role in science diplomacy efforts.
en-000012210	Pakistan is one of nine states to possess nuclear weapons, and the only Muslim majority country to do so.
en-000012211	The Kahuta Project started under the supervision of a coordination board that oversaw the activities of KRL and PAEC.
en-000012212	Ghulam Ishaq Khan and General Tikka Khan appointed military engineer Major General Ali Nawab to the program.
en-000012213	Eventually, the supervison passed to Lt General Zahid Ali Akbar in President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Administration.
en-000012214	Moderate uranium enrichment for the production of fissile material was achieved at KRL by April 1978.
en-000012215	Pakistan's nuclear weapons development was in response to the loss of East Pakistan in 1971's Bangladesh Liberation War.
en-000012216	This marked the beginning of Pakistan's pursuit of nuclear deterrence capability.
en-000012217	Pakistan's fissile material production takes place at Nilore, Kahuta, and Khushab/Jauharabad, where weapons-grade plutonium is refined.
en-000012218	Pakistan thus became the seventh country in the world to successfully develop and test nuclear weapons.
en-000012219	Atoms for Peace initiatives, followed by the establishment of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in 1956.
en-000012220	In 1953, Foreign minister Muhammad Zafarullah Khan publicly stated that "Pakistan does not have a policy towards the atom bombs".
en-000012221	Before 1971, Pakistan's nuclear development was peaceful but an effective deterrent against India, as Benazir Bhutto maintained in 1995.
en-000012222	Pakistan's nuclear energy programme was established and started in 1956 following the establishment of PAEC.
en-000012223	Pakistan became a participant in U.S. President Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program.
en-000012224	The first thing that was to be undertaken was the search for uranium.
en-000012225	Uranium deposits were discovered in the Dera Ghazi Khan district, and the first-ever national award was given to the PAEC.
en-000012226	In December 1965, then-foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto visited Vienna where he met IAEA nuclear engineer, Munir Ahmad Khan.
en-000012227	At a Vienna meeting on December, Khan informed Bhutto about the status of Indian nuclear program.
en-000012228	The PARR-II reactor was built and provided by PAEC under the IAEA safeguards as IAEA had funded this mega project.
en-000012229	Abdus Salam began lobbying for commercial nuclear power plants, and tirelessly advocated for nuclear power in Pakistan.
en-000012230	The construction began in 1966 as PAEC its general contractor as GE Canada provided nuclear materials and financial assistance.
en-000012231	Its project director was Parvez Butt, a nuclear engineer, and its construction completed in 1972.
en-000012232	Known as "KANUPP-I", it was inaugurated by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as President, and began its operations in November 1972.
en-000012233	Currently, Pakistan Government is planning to build another 400MWe commercial nuclear power plant.
en-000012234	Having known as "KANUPP-II", the PAEC completed its feasibility studies in 2009.
en-000012235	In 1965, amidst skirmishes that led up to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto announced:
en-000012236	Pakistani scientists and engineers'working at IAEA became aware of advancing Indian nuclear program towards making the bombs.
en-000012237	Because things were less expensive, the then costs were not more than US$150 million.
en-000012238	PAEC selected a team five senior scientists, including geophysicist Dr. Ahsan Mubarak, who were sent to Sellafield to receive technical training.
en-000012239	The PAEC in 1970 began work on a pilot-scale plant at Dera Ghazi Khan for the concentration of uranium ores.
en-000012240	Both these reactors are of 300 MW capacity and are being built at Chashma city of Punjab province.
en-000012241	The first of these, "CHASNUPP-I", began producing electricity in 2000, and'CHASNUPP-II', began its operation in fall of 2011.
en-000012242	Pakistan seemed to be isolated internationally, and in great danger; it felt that it could rely on no one but itself.
en-000012243	Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was "obsessed" with India's nuclear program.
en-000012244	Other theoreticians at Quaid-e-Azam University would also join the TPG, then led by Salam who had done ground-breaking work for TPG.
en-000012245	Among them was Riazuddin, Fayyazuddin, Masud Ahmad, and Faheem Hussain who were the cornerstone of the TPG.
en-000012246	With Abdus Salam departing, Munir Ahmad eventually led the TPG and assisted in the calculations.
en-000012247	Two types of weapon design were analyzed: the Gun-type fission weapon and the implosion nuclear weapon.
en-000012248	The program turned to the more technically difficult implosion-type weapon design, contrary to the relatively simple'gun-type'weapon.
en-000012249	Preliminary studies on gaseous centrifuge were already studied by PAEC in 1967 but yielded few results.
en-000012250	Khan advanced uranium enrichment from the expertise he had from the Urenco Group in the Netherlands.
en-000012251	The program evolved towards the boosted fission weapon designs that were eventually used in the Chagai-I tests in 1998.
en-000012252	On 11 March 1983, PAEC, led by Munir Ahmad Khan, carried out its first subcritical testing of a working nuclear device.
en-000012253	This is also called a cold test, and was codenamed "Kirana-I".
en-000012254	In 1972, Pakistan signed and ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in 1974.
en-000012255	Since then Pakistan has been a vocal and staunch supporter for the success of the BTWC.
en-000012256	Pakistan is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and is not bound by any of its provisions.
en-000012257	This initiative was taken a year after both countries had publicly tested nuclear weapons.
en-000012258	In the last 15 years, only one country – North Korea – has tested a nuclear weapon.
en-000012259	Since the early 1980s, Pakistan's nuclear proliferation activities have not been without controversy.
en-000012260	Pakistan is increasing its capacity to produce plutonium at its Khushab nuclear facility, a Washington-based science think tank has reported.
en-000012261	The Pakistanis are believed to be spiking their plutonium based nuclear weapons with tritium.
en-000012262	Only a few grams of tritium can result in an increase of the explosive yield by 300% to 400%."
en-000012263	A third and a fourth reactor and ancillary buildings are observed to be under construction at the Khushab site.
en-000012264	As of 2014, Pakistan has been reportedly developing smaller, more tactical nuclear weapons for potential use on the battlefield exclusively.
en-000012265	However, India and Pakistan reached three bilateral agreements on nuclear issues.
en-000012266	In 1989, they agreed not to attack each other's nuclear facilities.
en-000012267	Since then they have been regularly exchanging lists of nuclear facilities on 1 January of each year.
en-000012268	Another bilateral agreement was signed in March 2005 where both nations would alert the other on ballistic missile tests.
en-000012269	None of these agreements limits the nuclear weapons programs of either country in any way.
en-000012270	Pakistan has blocked negotiation of a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty as it continues to produce fissile material for weapons.
en-000012271	Responding to India's nuclear test in 1974, Munir Khan launched the uranium program, codename "Project-706" under the aegis of the PAEC.
en-000012272	To acquire the necessary equipment and material for this program, Khan developed a procurement ring.
en-000012273	Despite these efforts, it is claimed Khan Research Laboratories suffered setbacks until PAEC provided technical assistance.
en-000012274	In contrast PAEC was unable to enrich any Uranium or produce weapons grade fissile material until 1998.
en-000012275	The uranium program proved to be a difficult, challenging and most enduring approach to scale up to industrial levels to military-grade.
en-000012276	Commenting on the difficulty, mathematician Tasneem Shah; who worked with A.Q.
en-000012277	Many of Khan's fellow theorists were unsure about the feasibility of the enriched uranium on time despite Khan's strong advocacy.
en-000012278	As for Pakistan's plutonium capability, it has always been there (where?
en-000012279	Khan if Pakistan had the capability to produce fissile plutonium in the early 70s.
en-000012280	Khan from Europe to develop fissile uranium after PAEC failed to produce fissile plutonium by the 1976 deadline.
en-000012281	Since 1972, earlier efforts were directed towards plutonium and necessary infrastructure was built by Bhutto as early as the 1970s.
en-000012282	Contrary to popular perception, Pakistan did not forego or abandon the plutonium program and pursued it along with the uranium route.
en-000012283	Towards the end of the 1970s, the PAEC began to pursue plutonium production capabilities.
en-000012284	that it was designed and built by Pakistani scientists and engineers.
en-000012285	On 30 May 1998, Pakistan proved its plutonium capability in a scientific experiment and sixth nuclear test: codename Chagai-II.
en-000012286	The most recent analysis, published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 2010, estimates that Pakistan has 70–90 nuclear warheads.
en-000012287	In 2003, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace estimated a stockpile of approximately 50 weapons.
en-000012288	By contrast, in 2000, U.S. military and intelligence sources estimated that Pakistan's nuclear arsenal may be as large as 100 warheads.
en-000012289	Pakistan tested plutonium capability in the sixth nuclear test, codename Chagai-II, on 30 May 1998 at Kharan Desert.
en-000012290	The critical mass of a bare mass sphere of 90% enriched uranium-235 is 52 kg.
en-000012291	Correspondingly, the critical mass of a bare mass sphere of plutonium-239 is 8–10 kg.
en-000012292	The bomb that destroyed Hiroshima used 60 kg of U-235 while the Nagasaki Pu bomb used only 6 kg of Pu-239.
en-000012293	Since all Pakistani bomb designs are implosion-type weapons, they will typically use between 15–25 kg of U-235 for their cores.
en-000012294	And the uranium, like plutonium, is only usable in the core of a bomb in metallic form.
en-000012295	However, only 2–4 kg of plutonium is needed for the same device that would need 20–25 kg of U-235.
en-000012296	Ultra-centrifugation for obtaining U-235 cannot be done simply by putting natural uranium through the centrifuges.
en-000012297	The complete mastery of fluorine chemistry and production of highly toxic and corrosive hydrofluoric acid and other fluorine compounds is required.
en-000012298	It is estimated that there are approximately 10,000–20,000 centrifuges in Kahuta.
en-000012299	So it is safe to assume that between 1986 and 2005 (prior to the 2005 earthquake), KRL produced 1500 kg of HEU.
en-000012300	Pakistan's first nuclear tests were made in May 1998, when six warheads were tested under codename Chagai-I and Chagai-II.
en-000012301	It is reported that the yields from these tests were 12 kt, 30 to 36 kt and four low-yield (below 1 kt) tests.
en-000012302	According to a U.S. congressional report, Pakistan has addressed issues of survivability in a possible nuclear conflict through second strike capability.
en-000012303	Pakistan has built hard and deeply buried storage and launch facilities to retain a second strike capability in a nuclear war.
en-000012304	Don't assume that the Pakistan's nuclear capability is inferior to the Indians", General Zinni quoted to NBC.
en-000012305	It was confirmed that Pakistan has built Soviet-style road-mobile missiles, state-of-the-art air defences around strategic sites, and other concealment measures.
en-000012306	In 2008, the United States admitted that it did not know where all of Pakistan's nuclear sites are located.
en-000012307	Historically, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has been repeatedly charged with allegedly transferring missile and related materials to Pakistan.
en-000012308	China has consistently maintained that it has not sold any weapon parts or components to Pakistan or anyone else.
en-000012309	Pakistan is a friendly country with whom we have good economic and political relations."
en-000012310	Therefore, in 1989, Pakistan reached agreement with China for the supply of the 300-MW commercial "CHASHNUPP-1" nuclear reactor.
en-000012311	Yakunin, said that the USSR was considering a request from Pakistan for the supply of a nuclear power plant.
en-000012312	The Soviet and French civilian nuclear power plant was on its way during the 1990s.
en-000012313	After the U.S. concerns the civilian-nuclear technology agreements were cancelled by France and Soviet Union.
en-000012314	A military spokesperson stated that "Pakistan's threat of nuclear first-use deterred India from seriously considering conventional military strikes."
en-000012315	The theory of "N-deterrence" has been frequently being interpreted by the various government-in-time of effect of Pakistan.
en-000012316	Nuclear theorist Brigadier-General Feroz Hassan Khan adds:"The Pakistani situation is akin to NATO's position in the Cold War.
en-000012317	Pakistan's motive for pursuing a nuclear weapons development program is never to allow another invasion of Pakistan.
en-000012318	Pakistan has not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
en-000012319	Pakistan has responded to the report by stating that the United States itself has not ratified the CTBT.
en-000012320	Consequently, not all of Pakistan's nuclear facilities are under IAEA safeguards.
en-000012321	The government institutional organisation authorised to make critical decisions about Pakistan's nuclear posturing is the NCA.
en-000012322	The NCA has its genesis since the 1970s and has been constitutionally established in February 2000.
en-000012323	The committee includes key senior cabinet ministers as well as the respective military chiefs of staff.
en-000012324	The ECC reviews presentations on strategic threat perceptions, monitors the progress of weapons development, and decides on responses to emerging threats.
en-000012325	It also establishes guidelines for effective command-and-control practices to safeguard against the accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons.
en-000012326	The comprehensive nuclear force planning is integrated with conventional war planning at the National Security Council (NSC).
en-000012327	The DCC reaffirmed its policies on development of nuclear energy and arsenals through the country's media.
en-000012328	Specifically the USA has provided helicopters, night-vision goggles and nuclear detection equipment.
en-000012329	During this period Pakistan also began to develop a modern export control regulatory regime with U.S. assistance.
en-000012330	Since 2004 the U.S. government has reportedly been concerned about the safety of Pakistani nuclear facilities and weapons.
en-000012331	The region has more violent extremists than any other, the country is unstable, and its arsenal of nuclear weapons is expanding."
en-000012332	In April 2011, IAEA's deputy director general Denis Flory declared Pakistan's nuclear programme safe and secure.
en-000012333	At the same time, the Pakistani Government also denounced the article.
en-000012334	Pakistan consistently maintains that it has tightened the security over the several years.
en-000012335	As of 2011, Pakistan possesses a wide variety of nuclear capable medium range ballistic missiles with ranges up to 2500 km.
en-000012336	Pakistan also possesses nuclear tipped Babur cruise missiles with ranges up to 700 km.
en-000012337	The Babur cruise missile range can also be extended to 1000 km or more.
en-000012338	These land-based missiles are controlled by Army Strategic Forces Command of Pakistan Army.
en-000012339	These units are major part of the Air Force Strategic Command, a command responsible for nuclear response.
en-000012340	What Pakistan does once they get the planes is inevitably up to them,” he said.
en-000012341	The Pakistan Navy was first publicly reported to be considering deployment of nuclear weapons on submarines in February 2001.
en-000012342	According to the Navy, the nuclear submarine is an ambitious project, and will be designed and built indigenously.
en-000012343	Throughout Cambodia's long history, religion has been a major source of cultural inspiration.
en-000012344	While they shared a religion, Islam, there were major cultural and linguistic differences between East and West Pakistan.
en-000012345	Indian culture and civilization, including its languages and arts reached mainland Southeast Asia around the 1st century AD.
en-000012346	The Kingdom of Funan was most probably the first Khmer state to benefit from this influx of Indian ideas.
en-000012347	The Angkorian architects and sculptors created temples that mapped the cosmic world in stone.
en-000012348	Khmer decorations drew inspiration from religion, and mythical creatures from Hinduism and Buddhism were carved on walls.
en-000012349	The remains of secular architecture from this time are rare, as only religious buildings were made of stone.
en-000012350	It is constructed of a wooden frame with gabled thatch roof and walls of woven bamboo.
en-000012351	Khmer houses are typically raised as much as three meters on stilts for protection from annual floods.
en-000012352	The steep thatch roof overhanging the house walls protects the interior from rain.
en-000012353	Typically a house contains three rooms separated by partitions of woven bamboo.
en-000012354	Family members and neighbors work together to build the house, and a house-raising ceremony is held upon its completion.
en-000012355	The houses of poorer persons may contain only a single large room.
en-000012356	Food is prepared in a separate kitchen located near the house but usually behind it.
en-000012357	Toilet facilities consist of simple pits in the ground, located away from the house, that are covered up when filled.
en-000012358	Urban housing and commercial buildings may be of brick, masonry, or wood.
en-000012359	Buddhism has existed in Cambodia since at least the 5th century CE.
en-000012360	Islam is the religion of a majority of the Cham (also called Khmer Islam) and Malay minorities in Cambodia.
en-000012361	According to Po Dharma, there were 150,000 to 200,000 Muslims in Cambodia as late as 1975.
en-000012362	All of the Cham Muslims are Sunnis of the Shafi'i school.
en-000012363	Po Dharma divides the Muslim Cham in Cambodia into a traditionalist branch and an orthodox branch.
en-000012364	Christianity was introduced into Cambodia by Roman Catholic missionaries in 1660.
en-000012365	In 1972 there were probably about 20,000 Christians in Cambodia, most of whom were Roman Catholics.
en-000012366	In April 1970, just before repatriation, estimates indicate that about 50,000 Catholics were Vietnamese.
en-000012367	Many of the Catholics remaining in Cambodia in 1972 were Europeans—chiefly French.
en-000012368	The 1962 census, which reported 2,000 Protestants in Cambodia, remains the most recent statistic for the group.
en-000012369	There are around 20,000 Catholics in Cambodia which represents only 0.15% of the total population.
en-000012370	There are no dioceses, but there are three territorial jurisdictions- one Apostolic Vicariate and two Apostolic Prefectures.
en-000012371	Highland tribal groups, most with their own local religious systems, probably number fewer than 100,000 persons.
en-000012372	The Khmer Loeu have been loosely described as animists, but most tribal groups have their own pantheon of local spirits.
en-000012373	In general they see their world filled with various invisible spirits (often called yang), some benevolent, others malevolent.
en-000012374	They associate spirits with rice, soil, water, fire, stones, paths, and so forth.
en-000012375	Sorcerers or specialists in each village contact these spirits and prescribe ways to appease them.
en-000012376	In times of crisis or change, animal sacrifices may be made to placate the anger of the spirits.
en-000012377	Illness is often believed to be caused by evil spirits or sorcerers.
en-000012378	Some tribes have special medicine men or shamans who treat the sick.
en-000012379	In addition to belief in spirits, villagers believe in taboos on many objects or practices.
en-000012380	The birth of a child is a happy event for the family.
en-000012381	A woman who dies in childbirth—crosses the river (chhlong tonle) in Khmer is believed to become an evil spirit.
en-000012382	These traditions remain in practice in rural Cambodia, but they have become weakened in urban areas.
en-000012383	Buddhist Khmer usually are cremated, and their ashes are deposited in a stupa in the temple compound.
en-000012384	White pennant-shaped flags, called "white crocodile flags," outside a house indicate that someone in that household has died.
en-000012385	The spouse and the children show mourning by shaving their heads and by wearing white clothing.
en-000012386	A Cambodian child may be nursed until two to four years of age.
en-000012387	Up to the age of three or four, the child is given considerable physical affection and freedom.
en-000012388	Children around five years of age also may be expected to help look after younger siblings.
en-000012389	Children's games emphasize socialization or skill rather than winning and losing.
en-000012390	The father at this time begins his permanent retreat into a relatively remote, authoritarian role.
en-000012391	Age difference is strictly recognized with polite vocabulary and special generational terms for "you".
en-000012392	In theory, a girl may veto the spouse her parents have chosen for her.
en-000012393	A man usually marries between the ages of nineteen and twenty-five, a girl between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two.
en-000012394	Formerly it lasted three days, but in the 1980s it more commonly lasted a day and a half.
en-000012395	Buddhist priests offer a short sermon and recite prayers of blessing.
en-000012396	The majority of married Cambodian couples do not obtain legal marriage documents.
en-000012397	Marriage is seen more as a social institution, regulated by societal pressures, expectations and norms, than a legal matter.
en-000012398	Whether these traditional marriages are considered legal contracts by the government and courts is unclear.
en-000012399	Therefore, when a couple separate, they likewise need not obtain divorce documents.
en-000012400	Divorce is legal and relatively easy to obtain, but not common.
en-000012401	Each spouse retains whatever property he or she brought into the marriage, and jointly-acquired property is divided equally.
en-000012402	Divorced persons may remarry, but the woman must wait ten months.
en-000012403	The divorced male doesn't have a waiting period before he can remarry.
en-000012404	The consequences of the social upheaval caused by the Cambodian Civil War is still being felt.
en-000012405	At present there is variation in tradition from province to province.
en-000012406	In Siem Reap, it is widely understood, for example, that the man takes the first-born child upon separation.
en-000012407	Men who leave their families typically do not support their other children, especially when they leave one woman for another woman.
en-000012408	The new woman and her family will not accept children from a previous relationship.
en-000012409	The greater a person's age, the greater the level of respect that must be granted to them.
en-000012410	Cambodians are addressed with a hierarchical title corresponding to their seniority before the name.
en-000012411	At this stage in their lives, they enjoy a position of high status.
en-000012412	The nuclear family, consisting of a husband and a wife and their unmarried children, is the most important kin group.
en-000012413	In rural communities, neighbors—who are often also kin—may be important, too.
en-000012414	Fictive child-parent, sibling, and close friend relationships Cambodia transcend kinship boundaries and serve to strengthen interpersonal and interfamily ties.
en-000012415	Beyond this close circle are more distant relatives and casual friends.
en-000012416	A strong feeling of pride—for the village, for the district, and province—usually characterizes Cambodian community life.
en-000012417	Legally, the husband is the head of the Khmer family, but the wife has considerable authority, especially in family economics.
en-000012418	Clothing in Cambodia is one of the most important aspects of the culture.
en-000012419	The "krama" is what distinctly separates the Khmer (Cambodians) from their neighbors the Thai, the Vietnamese, and the Laotians.
en-000012420	A "krama" can also be easily shaped into a small child's doll for play.
en-000012421	Under the Khmer Rouge, krama of various patterns were part of standard clothing.
en-000012422	The long-popular traditional garment known as the "Sampot", is an Indian-influenced costume which Cambodians have worn since the Funan era.
en-000012423	Historically, Khmer clothing has changed depending on the time period and religion.
en-000012424	As Buddhism began to replace Hinduism, Khmer people started wearing the blouse, shirt and trousers of Khmer style.
en-000012425	Some Khmer men and women wear a Buddha pendant on a necklace.
en-000012426	Most royalty prefer "Sampot Phamuong", a new version of sampot adapted by Thai people in the 17th century.
en-000012427	Since the Udong period, most royalty have retained their dressing habits.
en-000012428	The sbai or rabai kanorng would have been sumptuously fashioned in the old days in threads of genuine gold or silver.
en-000012429	The cape in the old days would have hung down to the hem of the Sampot.
en-000012430	Dancers wear a collar known as "Sarong Kor" around their necks.
en-000012431	A multitude of jewellery is also worn by the female dancers.
en-000012432	A circular or diamond shaped pendant is worn around the neck.
en-000012433	There are several different types of mokot worn by female royalty.
en-000012434	The typical mokots that are worn are much similar to those of male royalty.
en-000012435	Some crowns are just like tiaras where at the back of the mokot hair is let loose, cascading down the back.
en-000012436	Khmer cuisine is similar to that of its Southeast Asian neighbors.
en-000012437	It shares many similarities with Thai cuisine, Vietnamese cuisine and Teochew cuisine.
en-000012438	Cambodian cuisine also uses fish sauce in soups, stir-fried cuisine, and as dippings.
en-000012439	When prahok is not used, it is likely to be "kapǐ" (កាពិ) instead, a kind of fermented shrimp paste.
en-000012440	Coconut milk is the main ingredient of many Khmer curries and desserts.
en-000012441	The latter is used more in dessert dishes with fruits such as durian while jasmine rice is eaten with meals.
en-000012442	Typically, Cambodians eat their meals with at least three or four separate dishes.
en-000012443	Each individual dish will usually be one of either sweet, sour, salty or bitter.
en-000012444	Chili is usually left up to the individual to add themselves.
en-000012445	In this way Cambodians ensure that they get a bit of every flavor to satisfy their palates.
en-000012446	Regional Cambodian cuisine offers some unique dishes influenced by the traditions of local ethnic groups.
en-000012447	This dish is prepared with a local crab fried with the black pepper from area pepper fields.
en-000012448	The region between Siem Reap and Kampong Thom, an area with many Chinese Cambodians, displays Khmer versions of many Chinese dishes.
en-000012449	Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile weaving, silversmithing, stone carving, lacquerware, ceramics, wat murals, and kite-making.
en-000012450	The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.
en-000012451	However, after their deaths, new music stars have tried to bring back the music.
en-000012452	The Cambodian pinpeat ensemble is traditionally heard on feast days in the pagodas.
en-000012453	It is also a court ensemble used to accompany classical dance for ritual occasions or theatrical events.
en-000012454	Cambodian Dance can be divided into three main categories: classical dance, folk dances, and vernacular dances.
en-000012455	Khmer classical dance is a form of Cambodian dance originally performed only for royalty.
en-000012456	The dances have many elements in common with Thai classical dance.
en-000012457	Reamker, a khmer version of Indian, Ramayana had influenced strongly to Khmer classical dance.
en-000012458	The movements and gestures are not as stylized as Khmer classical dance.
en-000012459	Folk dancers wear clothes of the people they are portraying such as Chams, hill tribes, farmers, and peasants.
en-000012460	Cambodian vernacular dances (or social dances) are those danced at social gatherings.
en-000012461	Such dances include "Romvong", "Rom Kbach", "Rom Saravan," and "Lam Leav".
en-000012462	Some of these dances have much influence from the traditional dances of Laos.
en-000012463	But "Rom Kbach", for example, take heavily from the classical dance of the royal court.
en-000012464	Other social dances from around the world have influenced Cambodian social culture including the Cha-cha, Bolero, and the Madison.
en-000012465	A testimony of the antiquity of the Khmer language are the multitude of epigraphic inscriptions on stone.
en-000012466	The first written proof that has allowed the history of the Khmer Kingdom to be reconstructed are those inscriptions.
en-000012467	They were written by the monks on palmyra palm leaves and kept in various monasteries throughout the country.
en-000012468	The Reamker is the most ubiquitous form of traditional Cambodian theatre.
en-000012469	This French civil servant claimed that he had obtained the story from old Uncle Nip in Somrontong District.
en-000012470	In 2006 the Vorvong and Sorvong story was enacted in dance form by the Royal Ballet of Cambodia.
en-000012471	The story has been portrayed in many forms including oral, historical, literary, theatre, and film adaptions.
en-000012472	The prolific King Ang Duong is most famous for his novel "Kakey", inspired from a Jataka tale about an unfaithful woman.
en-000012473	Cinema in Cambodia began in the 1950s; King Norodom Sihanouk himself was an avid film enthusiast.
en-000012474	Many films were being screened in theaters throughout the country by the 1960s, which are regarded as the "golden age".
en-000012475	Cambodia has increasingly become involved in sports over the last 30 years.
en-000012476	Football is popular as are martial arts, including bokator, pradal serey (Khmer kick boxing), and Khmer traditional wrestling.
en-000012477	Unlike kickboxing, which is a sport fighting art, "bokator" was a soldier’s art, designed to be used on the battlefield.
en-000012478	When fighting, bokator practitioners still wear the uniforms of ancient Khmer armies.
en-000012479	Pradal serey, or traditional Khmer kickboxing, is a popular sport in Cambodia.
en-000012480	Styles of boxing have been practiced in Southeast Asia since ancient times.
en-000012481	In the Angkor era, both armed and unarmed martial arts were practiced by the Khmers.
en-000012482	Evidence shows that a style resembling pradal serey existed around the 9th century.
en-000012483	A wrestling match consists of three rounds, which may be won by forcing an opponent to his back.
en-000012484	Traditional matches are held during the Khmer New Year and other Cambodian holidays.
en-000012485	The Cambodian Football Federation is the governing body of football in Cambodia, controlling the Cambodian national football team.
en-000012486	Phnom Pehn National Olympic Stadium is the national stadium, with a capacity of 50,000 in Phnom Penh.
en-000012487	Serving more than 36’000 beneficiaries per year, UNITAR conducts close to 500 training and research activities around the world.
en-000012488	The Institute is supported by voluntary contributions from governments, intergovernmental organizations, foundations and the private sector.
en-000012489	UNITAR helps governments to understand climate change, chemicals and waste management, and green economy.
en-000012490	Through its programme on operational satellite applications (UNOSAT), the Institute provides satellite imagery and analysis.
en-000012491	Since 2003 UNITAR provides courses to support municipal and regional leaders dealing with complex public policies.
en-000012492	UNITAR also spearheads UN inter-agency initiatives such as the one UN Learning platform on Climate Change or the Global Migration Group.
en-000012493	UNITAR’s research activities are focusing on knowledge systems and their practical applications.
en-000012494	However, many countries are poorly equipped to design, implement and monitor sound development strategies.
en-000012495	Any country with a sensible development strategy has the opportunity to make its economy grow, with assistance from trade.
en-000012496	UNITAR strengthens countries'capacities to help them achieve their development priorities and translate multilateral norms and decisions into practice.
en-000012497	This is at the heart of the Organization’s work and continues to be a pressing priority for Member States.
en-000012498	This area of work includes most of UNITAR’s research efforts in the areas of technology applications and innovation.
en-000012499	UNITAR is home to an advanced centre of excellence for satellite imagery and data analysis (UNOSAT).
en-000012500	The Extra Flugzeugbau EA300 is a two-seat aerobatic monoplane capable of Unlimited category competition.
en-000012501	It was designed in 1987 by Walter Extra, a German aerobatic pilot, and built by Extra Flugzeugbau.
en-000012502	Design of the Extra 300 was based on the Extra 230, an early 1980s monoplane having a wing made of wood.
en-000012503	The Extra 300 has a welded steel tube fuselage covered in aluminium and fabric.
en-000012504	The mid-set wing has a carbon fiber composite spar and carbon composite skins.
en-000012505	Carbon-fiber composites are making cars and airplanes both more resistant and lighter, reducing their fuel consumption.
en-000012506	A symmetrical airfoil, mounted with a zero angle of incidence, provides equal performance in both upright and inverted flight.
en-000012507	The landing gear is fixed taildragger style with composite main legs and fiberglass wheel pants.
en-000012508	The powerplant is a fuel-injected Lycoming AEIO-540 which produces 300 horsepower (224 kW).
en-000012509	The Extra 300 is stressed for ±10 G with one person on board and ±8 G with two.
en-000012510	Some Extra 300s are certificated in the Experimental Category in the U.S., while others are certificated in the Aerobatic category.
en-000012511	The Bumiputera (or Bumiputra) is derived from the Sanskrit word'Bhumiputra'(भूमिपुत्र), which roughly translated means'sons of the soil'.
en-000012512	In both Malaysia and Brunei the term is used to refer to a member of majority Malay ethnic group.
en-000012513	It can also refer to members of certain indigenous groups as outlined below.
en-000012514	The Brunei Constitution defines a Bumiputera as a member of the following ethnic groups:
en-000012515	This is different from the definition in Malaysia where a larger number of races and ethnic groups are considered as Bumiputra.
en-000012516	Constitutional references to Bumiputeras can be found in Section 160 (2) of the Constitution of Brunei Darassalam.
en-000012517	There are a number of affirmative action items targeting the Bumiputeras in Brunei.
en-000012518	One case of such disadvantage can be seen in the demise of the construction industry in Brunei.
en-000012519	The building sector is a major employer of Bumiputeras and forms the lifeblood of many Bumiputera families.
en-000012520	As such, they are the group in society most affected by the global economic crisis.
en-000012521	In the wake of the global economic crisis, emerging markets have become the engines of worldwide growth.
en-000012522	In the past, government policies in relation to economic recovery has been directly focussed on improving the position of Bumiputeras.
en-000012523	A major part of that plan was to actively encourage and subsidise investment in Bumiputera-owned businesses.
en-000012524	The term Bumiputera often connotes those people of Malay-speaking ethnic groups who belong to the Islamic faith.
en-000012525	Indeed, it has become advantageous for Bruneians to convert to Islam to truly qualify for Bumiputera status.
en-000012526	In the 1970s, many indigenous people converted to Islam for this reason.
en-000012527	This may be because affirmative action strategies are not so prevalent or obvious in Bruneian society.
en-000012528	The entity is the legal owner of a set of mortgages, called a "pool".
en-000012529	The legal entity, collateral, and structure are collectively referred to as the "deal".
en-000012530	Unlike traditional mortgage pass-through securities, CMOs feature different payment streams and risks, depending on investor preferences.
en-000012531	For tax purposes, CMOs are generally structured as Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits, which avoid the potential for "double-taxation."
en-000012532	Investors in CMOs include banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, government agencies, and most recently central banks.
en-000012533	Governments should also encourage public pension funds to invest responsibly, especially when it comes to the climate.
en-000012534	This article focuses primarily on CMO bonds as traded in the United States of America.
en-000012535	For example, a $300,000 30 year mortgage with an interest rate of 6.5% could be split into 300 1000 dollar bonds.
en-000012536	However, this format of bond has various problems for various investors
en-000012537	Salomon Brothers and First Boston created the CMO concept to address these issues.
en-000012538	Whenever a group of mortgages is split into different classes of bonds, the risk does not disappear.
en-000012539	Some classes receive less risk of a particular type; other classes more risk of that type.
en-000012540	How much the risk is reduced or increased for each class depends on how the classes are structured.
en-000012541	GSE guaranteed loans can serve as collateral for "Agency CMOs", which are subject to interest rate risk but not credit risk.
en-000012542	Whole loan CMOs are subject to both credit risk and interest rate risk.
en-000012543	The most common form of credit protection is called credit tranching.
en-000012544	If the "overcollateralization" turns into "undercollateralization" (the assumptions of the default rate were inadequate), then the CMO defaults.
en-000012545	Another way to enhance credit protection is to issue bonds that pay a lower interest rate than the underlying mortgages.
en-000012546	The principal (and associated coupon) stream for CMO collateral can be structured to allocate prepayment risk.
en-000012547	Investors in CMOs wish to be protected from prepayment risk as well as credit risk.
en-000012548	There are several reasons that this type of tranching would be done:
en-000012549	If they have floating coupons, they would have a formula that make their total interest equal to the collateral interest.
en-000012550	This type of tranche supports other tranches by not receiving an interest payment.
en-000012551	The Z tranche starts receiving interest and principal payments only after the other tranches in the CMO have been fully paid.
en-000012552	This type of tranche is often used to customize sequential tranches, or VADM tranches.
en-000012553	The schedule is maintained by using support bonds (also called companion bonds) that absorb the excess prepayments.
en-000012554	Instead of a support bond, they are supported by accretion of a Z bond.
en-000012555	Because of this, a VADM tranche will receive the scheduled prepayments even if no prepayments are made on the underlying.
en-000012556	NAS bonds are designed to protect investors from volatility and negative convexity resulting from prepayments.
en-000012557	NAS tranches are usually found in deals that also contain short sequentials, Z-bonds, and credit subordination.
en-000012558	NASquentials were introduced in mid-2005 and represented an innovative structural twist, combining the standard NAS (Non-Accelerated Senior) and Sequential structures.
en-000012559	Unlike with a NAS, no shifting interest mechanism is employed after the initial lockout date.
en-000012560	The resulting bonds offer superior stability versus regular sequentials, and yield pickup versus PACs.
en-000012561	The support-like cashflows falling out on the other side of NASquentials are sometimes referred to as RUSquentials (Relatively Unstable Sequentials).
en-000012562	The coupon stream from the mortgage collateral can also be restructured (analogous to the way the principal stream is structured).
en-000012563	This coupon stream allocation is performed after prepayment tranching is complete.
en-000012564	If the coupon tranching is done on the collateral without any prepayment tranching, then the resulting tranches are called'strips'.
en-000012565	The benefit is that the resulting CMO tranches can be targeted to very different sets of investors.
en-000012566	In general, coupon tranching will produce a pair (or set) of complementary CMO tranches.
en-000012567	An IO pays a coupon only based on a notional principal, it receives no principal payments from amortization or prepayments.
en-000012568	Note the resulting notional principle of the IO is less than the original principal.
en-000012569	A PO pays no coupon, but receives principal payments from amortization and prepayments.
en-000012570	The simplest coupon tranching is to allocate the coupon stream to an IO, and the principal stream to a PO.
en-000012571	This is generally only done on the whole collateral without any prepayment tranching, and generates strip IOs and strip POs.
en-000012572	The construction of CMO Floaters is the most effective means of getting additional market liquidity for CMOs.
en-000012573	8% when LIBOR is 5%) In creating a CMO floater, a CMO Inverse is generated.
en-000012574	The CMO inverse is a more complicated instrument to hedge and analyse, and is usually sold to sophisticated investors.
en-000012575	The construction of a floater/inverse can be seen in two stages.
en-000012576	In the example, the 8% coupon of the'8 off 6'is cut into a floater coupon of:
en-000012577	The inverse formula is simply the difference of the original premium fixed rate coupon less the floater formula.
en-000012578	In the example the inverse generated is a'$25mm 3 times levered 7.6 strike LIBOR SEQ inverse'.
en-000012579	Other structures include Inverse IOs, TTIBs, Digital TTIBs/Superfloaters, and'mountain'bonds.
en-000012580	An interest only (IO) strip may be carved from collateral securities to receive just the interest portion of a payment.
en-000012581	Once an underlying debt is paid off, that debt's future stream of interest is terminated.
en-000012582	Therefore, IO securities are highly sensitive to prepayments and/or interest rates and bear more risk.
en-000012583	A principal only (PO) strip may be carved from collateral securities to receive just the principal portion of a payment.
en-000012584	The increased effective duration must balance the matching IO's negative effective duration to equal the collateral's effective duration, or 2.
en-000012585	Bonds with lower coupons usually have higher effective durations and a PO has no [zero] coupon.)
en-000012586	POs have investor demand as hedges against IO type streams (e.g.
en-000012587	The Tears were an English rock band, formed in 2004 by ex-Suede bandmates Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler.
en-000012588	The duo were a much anticipated reunion and music critics praised their first concerts and debut album, "Here Come The Tears".
en-000012589	In 1994, when Bernard Butler walked out of Suede, they were the biggest new band in Britain.
en-000012590	He was pilloried in the music press and characterised as "demanding, difficult and egotistical" by Brett Anderson.
en-000012591	The band played their first ever live show on 14 December 2004 at the Oxford Zodiac.
en-000012592	From the start, Anderson was insistent that the band would not be playing any songs by Suede.
en-000012593	The single was a success and peaked in the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart.
en-000012594	The band's debut album, "Here Come the Tears" followed on 6 June 2005.
en-000012595	It was released to generally favourable reviews that helped solidify the duo's comeback.
en-000012596	However it failed to crack the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart.
en-000012597	I am proud of the record we made, but the obsession with us stopped us enjoying it."
en-000012598	In late June, the band played a set at the John Peel stage at the Glastonbury Festival.
en-000012599	The second single from the debut album, entitled "Lovers", was released in June.
en-000012600	Though a significantly lower charting than the previous single, it still managed to reach number 24.
en-000012601	However, the tour was soon cancelled and the band were dropped from their label.
en-000012602	In August 2006, the band's official site and forum were closed.
en-000012603	"The chance of there being another Tears record in the future is pretty good actually."
en-000012604	These hopes were short-lived, however when Butler announced his retirement from performing in 2008 to concentrate on producing.
en-000012605	Let's hope that the effects of the present spike will be more short-lived.
en-000012606	The Peru–Bolivian Confederation (or Confederacy) was a short-lived confederate state that existed in South America between 1836 and 1839.
en-000012607	Its first and only head of state, titled“Supreme Protector”, was the Bolivian president, Marshal Andrés de Santa Cruz.
en-000012608	In 1776, it was administratively severed and became a province of the newly created Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata.
en-000012609	The Peru–Bolivian Confederation was the only effective attempt to unite them.
en-000012610	At this point in time, a union with Peru was widely supported.
en-000012611	Political unrest and turmoil forced Bolívar to return to Colombia very soon thereafter, leaving Antonio José de Sucre in charge.
en-000012612	Nevertheless, the plan for reuniting Peru and Bolivia did not fade away.
en-000012613	The very next year, an armed uprising in Chuquisaca was quickly used by Peru as an excuse to invade Bolivia.
en-000012614	General Agustín Gamarra marched with an army of nearly 5,000 Peruvian soldiers.
en-000012615	The Peruvian army entered La Paz, Bolivia, on May 28, 1828.
en-000012616	Under these circumstances, Sucre was forced to resign in September, leaving the country forever.
en-000012617	Both Gamarra and Santa Cruz agreed that the separation of Peru and Bolivia was a mistake that should be corrected.
en-000012618	Gamarra was in favor of a Peruvian-led union, while Santa Cruz wanted to give more political power to Bolivia.
en-000012619	Furious about the news in Bolivia, he resolved to declare war against Peru on June 3, 1828.
en-000012620	Marshal Sucre was appointed commander of the Colombian army but was soon afterwards murdered.
en-000012621	After Bolívar’s death in 1830, the Colombian troops withdrew, and the war came to an end.
en-000012622	His rule was difficult, since armed revolts all around the country challenged his authority.
en-000012623	A new parliament was formed in 1833, but this time it was hostile towards Gamarra.
en-000012624	Gamarra did not recognize the new government, and prepared himself to challenge Orbegoso.
en-000012625	General Orbegoso also had to deal with General Felipe Salaverry, who rebelled and overthrew him in 1835.
en-000012626	Orbegoso, however, did not lose the support of southern Peru and called in to his help the president of Bolivia.
en-000012627	It was the opportunity that Marshal Santa Cruz, himself a former president of Peru, was waiting for.
en-000012628	With Bolivian help, General Orbegoso quickly regained his leadership throughout the country and had Salaverry executed.
en-000012629	Santa Cruz assumed the "supreme protectorship" of the confederation and Orbegoso maintained only the presidency of the newly created "Nor-Peruvian" state.
en-000012630	Marshal Andrés de Santa Cruz promoted a project to reunite the two territories on the basis of a confederacy.
en-000012631	This integration was based not only on historical, cultural and ethnic reasons, but also on economic motives.
en-000012632	The union was attempting to restore the ancient commercial routes and promote a policy of open markets.
en-000012633	In each case, he became the new state’s“supreme protector” (see protector (title) for similar titles), a president with full powers.
en-000012634	The president has fewer powers than it seems, overshadowed particularly by Supreme Guide Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
en-000012635	After the preceding period of significant political unrest, the Peru–Bolivian Confederation was proclaimed on October 28, 1836.
en-000012636	The creation of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation by Marshal Andrés de Santa Cruz caused great alarm in the neighbouring countries.
en-000012637	But that was just one of the reasons behind the war.
en-000012638	For the north-Peruvians also, the Confederation was viewed as the most serious threat to their economic interests.
en-000012639	After the failure of the expedition, the Chilean government became openly hostile towards the Confederation.
en-000012640	He ordered a raid on the Confederate fleet that was stationed in the port of Callao.
en-000012641	Instead of immediately going to war, Marshal Santa Cruz tried to negotiate with Chile.
en-000012642	To aggravate further the Chilean position, Chilean public opinion was totally opposed to a war they did not understand.
en-000012643	Political and public opposition to the war immediately affected the army, fresh from the purges of the civil war of 1830.
en-000012644	Admiral Manuel Blanco Encalada, in charge of the defense of Valparaíso, defeated him right outside the port.
en-000012645	This murder was perceived as having been orchestrated by Marshal Santa Cruz and turned the tide of public opinion.
en-000012646	Fiji and New Zealand were originally part of this process, but they decided not to join the federation.
en-000012647	The efforts to bring about federation in the mid-19th century were dogged by the lack of popular support for the movement.
en-000012648	A number of conventions were held during the 1890s to develop a constitution for the Commonwealth.
en-000012649	Sir Henry Parkes, Premier of New South Wales, was instrumental in this process.
en-000012650	The election returned Barton as prime minister, though without a majority.
en-000012651	The idea of being "Australian" began to be celebrated in songs and poems.
en-000012652	Sir Henry Parkes, then Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, first proposed a Federal Council body in 1867.
en-000012653	Sir Samuel Griffith, the Premier of Queensland, drafted a bill to constitute the Federal Council.
en-000012654	The conference successfully petitioned the Imperial Parliament to enact the bill as the "Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885".
en-000012655	The self-governing colonies of Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, as well as the Crown Colonies of Western Australia and Fiji, became involved.
en-000012656	Furthermore, the absence of the powerful colony of New South Wales weakened its representative value.
en-000012657	It provided an opportunity for Federalists from around the country to meet and exchange ideas.
en-000012658	These were not the only concerns of those resistant to federation.
en-000012659	New South Wales, traditionally free-trade in its outlook, wanted to be satisfied that the federation's tariff policy would not be protectionist.
en-000012660	Victorian Premier James Service described fiscal union as "the lion in the way" of federation.
en-000012661	A further fundamental issue was how to distribute the excess customs duties from the central government to the states.
en-000012662	Even without the concerns, there was debate about the form of government that a federation would take.
en-000012663	In particular, the United States had experienced the traumatic Civil War.
en-000012664	The nascent Australian labour movement was less than wholly committed in its support for federation.
en-000012665	In fact, the proposed federal constitution was criticised by labour representatives as being too conservative.
en-000012666	These representative wanted to see a federal government with more power to legislate on issues such as wages and prices.
en-000012667	The government then uses its coercive power to keep a lid on price growth.
en-000012668	Religious factors played a small but not trivial part in disputes over whether federation was desirable or even possible.
en-000012669	In the early 1890s two meetings established the need for federation and set the framework for this to occur.
en-000012670	An informal meeting attended by official representatives from the Australasian colonies was held in 1890.
en-000012671	This led to the first National Australasian Convention, meeting in Sydney in 1891.
en-000012672	The Conference of 1890 was organised at the instigation of Parkes.
en-000012673	Parkes reportedly boasted that he "could confederate these colonies in twelve months".
en-000012674	Parkes the next day wrote to the Premier of Victoria, Duncan Gillies, offering to advance the cause of Federation.
en-000012675	Gillies's response was predictably cool, given the reluctance of Parkes to bring New South Wales into the Federal Council.
en-000012676	In October Parkes travelled north to Brisbane and met with Griffith and Sir Thomas McIlwraith.
en-000012677	Through the latter part of 1889 the premiers and governors corresponded and agreed for an informal meeting to be called.
en-000012678	The Conference debated whether or not the time was ripe to proceed with federation.
en-000012679	While some of the delegates agreed it was, the smaller states were not as enthusiastic.
en-000012680	Thomas Playford from South Australia indicated the tariff question and lack of popular support as hurdles.
en-000012681	A basic question at this early assembly was how to structure the federation within the Westminster tradition of government.
en-000012682	There was less enthusiasm, however, for the centralism of the Canadian Constitution, especially from the smaller states.
en-000012683	Following the conference of 1890, the Canadian federal model was no longer considered appropriate for the Australian situation.
en-000012684	He presented it as an alternative to the Canadian model, arguing that Canada was "an instance of amalgamation rather than Federation."
en-000012685	The introduction by Deakin of James Bryce's "The American Commonwealth" also had far-reaching influence.
en-000012686	The conference in Melbourne ended with an agreement by the delegates that the time for federation had arrived.
en-000012687	A. I. Clark had given considerable thought towards a suitable constitution for Australia.
en-000012688	Clark's draft introduced the nomenclature and form which was subsequently adopted:
en-000012689	Upon his return to Hobart in early November 1890, with the technical aid of W. O.
en-000012690	Wise, the Tasmanian Parliamentary Draftsman, Clark completed the final form of the Draft Constitution and had a number of copies printed.
en-000012691	In February 1891, Inglis Clark circulated copies of his draft to Parkes, Barton and probably Playford as well.
en-000012692	This draft was always intended to be a private working document, and never has been published.
en-000012693	Indeed, 86 Sections (out of a total of 128) of the final Australian Constitution are recognisable in Clark's draft.
en-000012694	The Parliament proposed at the Convention of 1891 was to adopt the nomenclature of the United States Congress.
en-000012695	Over the Easter weekend in 1891, Griffith edited Clark's draft aboard the Queensland Government's steam yacht "Lucinda".
en-000012696	(Clark was not present, as he was ill with influenza in Sydney).
en-000012697	There were two so-called People's Conventions held in Corowa and Bathurst.
en-000012698	After the Adelaide meeting, the colonial Parliaments took the opportunity to debate the emerging Bill and to suggest changes.
en-000012699	The basic principles discussed in 1891 were adopted, with the addition of the principle of responsible government.
en-000012700	There was also a consensus for more democracy in the constitutional structure.
en-000012701	A draft bill was drawn up in 1898, and then sent to each colony to be ratified by the electorate.
en-000012702	Referendums were held in four of the colonies in June 1898.
en-000012703	Known as the "Braddon Clause", the amendments provided for the return of customs revenue to the states for ten years.
en-000012704	The Bill as accepted by the colonies went to Britain for ratification by the British Parliament.
en-000012705	Sir Edmund Barton was sworn in as the interim Prime Minister, leading an interim Federal ministry of nine members.
en-000012706	The new constitution established a bicameral Parliament, containing a Senate and a House of Representatives.
en-000012707	The office of Governor-General was established as the Queen's representative; initially, this person was considered a representative of the British government.
en-000012708	The Constitution also established a High Court, and divided the powers of government between the states and the new Commonwealth government.
en-000012709	The significance of Federation for Australia is such that a number of landmarks, natural and man-made, have been named after it.
en-000012710	NMC also has an observatory, and a nursing program in conjunction with Munson Medical Center.
en-000012711	The campus is home to WNMC-FM, a community-supported radio station which broadcasts at 90.7 FM.
en-000012712	This station began as a student organization in 1967 and still receives significant funding through student fees.
en-000012713	NMC offers Associate in Applied Science degrees in the following fields:
en-000012714	The Dennos Museum Center is a museum of fine art affiliated with Northwestern Michigan College.
en-000012715	The museum consists of an outdoor sculpture garden, several galleries for temporary exhibits, and the Inuit Gallery.
en-000012716	It offers an array of exhibitions and programs in the visual arts, sciences and performing arts.
en-000012717	Monetary policy is an art, not a science; it is the art of taking one’s best guess.
en-000012718	A significant collection of outdoor sculptures by international and Michigan artists surround the Museum on the campus of Northwestern Michigan College.
en-000012719	The college awarded its first bachelor's degrees to two academy students in January, 2014.
en-000012720	A division of NMC, Great Lakes Maritime Academy is also a partner of Ferris State University.
en-000012721	The college has renovated some of the buildings in which classes are conducted and recently built two new buildings.
en-000012722	The new Maritime Campus is a striking architectural landmark on West Grand Traverse Bay.
en-000012723	The campus also contains a convention center and a culinary arts program.
en-000012724	The conditionality clauses attached to the loans have been criticized because of their effects on the social sector.
en-000012725	The bank from which a borrowing country receives its loan depends upon the type of necessity.
en-000012726	The IMF usually implements stabilization policies and the WB is in charge of adjustment measures.
en-000012727	SAPs are supposed to allow the economies of the developing countries to become more market oriented.
en-000012728	This then forces them to concentrate more on trade and production so it can boost their economy.
en-000012729	These programs include internal changes (notably privatization and deregulation) as well as external ones, especially the reduction of trade barriers.
en-000012730	Countries that fail to enact these programmes may be subject to severe fiscal discipline.
en-000012731	SAPs were often criticized for implementing generic free-market policy and for their lack of involvement from the borrowing country.
en-000012732	The content of PRSPs has turned out to be similar to the original content of bank-authored SAPs.
en-000012733	These conditions have also been sometimes labeled as the Washington Consensus.
en-000012734	Structural adjustment policies emerged from two of the Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF and the World Bank.
en-000012735	They emerged from the conditionality that IMF and World Bank have been attaching to their loans since the early 1950s.
en-000012736	In particular, Western companies sought to gain access to the extraction of raw commodities, especially minerals and agricultural products.
en-000012737	Loans made under SAP conditions at the time were advised by the top economists of both the IMF and World Bank.
en-000012738	This was successful, as can be seen from the current account of the country's balance of payments.
en-000012739	To this day, economists can point to few, if any, examples of substantial economic growth among the LDCs under SAPs.
en-000012740	Pressure mounts to forgive these debts, some of which demand substantial portions of government expenditures to service.
en-000012741	These fiscal disasters led policy makers to decide that deeper intervention was necessary to improve a country's overall well-being.
en-000012742	In 2002, SAPs underwent another transition, the introduction of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers.
en-000012743	In addition, SAPs with their emphasis on poverty reduction have attempted to further align themselves with the Millennium Development Goals.
en-000012744	Since their inception, SAPs have been adopted by a number of other international financial institutions.
en-000012745	There are multiple criticisms that focus on different elements of SAPs.
en-000012746	Critics claim that SAPs threaten the sovereignty of national economies because an outside organization is dictating a nation's economic policy.
en-000012747	Critics argue that the creation of good policy is in a sovereign nation's own best interest.
en-000012748	Thus, SAPs are unnecessary given the state is acting in its best interest.
en-000012749	In many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, political instability has gone hand in hand with gross economic decline.
en-000012750	A common policy required in structural adjustment is the privatization of state-owned industries and resources.
en-000012751	This policy aims to increase efficiency and investment and to decrease state spending.
en-000012752	State-owned resources are to be sold whether they generate a fiscal profit or not.
en-000012753	Furthermore, state-owned firms may show fiscal losses because they fulfill a wider social role, such as providing low-cost utilities and jobs.
en-000012754	Critics hold SAPs responsible for much of the economic stagnation that has occurred in borrowing countries.
en-000012755	The programs most often cut are education, public health, and other social safety nets.
en-000012756	Commonly, these are programs that are already underfunded and desperately need monetary investment for improvement.
en-000012757	For example, if a government cuts education funding, universality is impaired, and therefore long-term economic growth.
en-000012758	For example, the education industry now touts the economic value of a college degree.
en-000012759	Recent studies have shown strong connections between SAPs and tuberculosis rates in developing nations.
en-000012760	Countries with native populations living traditional lifestyles face with unique challenges in regards to structural adjustment.
en-000012761	Kinship-based societies, for example, operate under the rule that collective group resources are not to serve individual purposes.
en-000012762	Gender roles and obligations, familial relations, lineage, and household organization all play a part in the functioning of traditional society.
en-000012763	There are some serious problems in measuring the empirical success of Fund programs.
en-000012764	It is extremely difficult to calculate the counterfactual; that is, what would have happened had the Fund not intervened.
en-000012765	However, the World Bank also provides balance of payments support, usually through adjustment packages jointly negotiated with the IMF.
en-000012766	IMF loans focus on temporarily fixing problems that countries face as a whole.
en-000012767	Traditionally IMF loans were meant to be repaid in a short duration between 2½ and 4 years.
en-000012768	Today, there are a few longer term options available, which go up to 7
en-000012769	as well as options that lend to countries in times of crises such as natural disasters or conflicts.
en-000012770	Currently there are 185 Members of the IMF (As Of February 2007) and 184 members of the World Bank.
en-000012771	Members are assigned a quota to be reevaluated and paid on a rotating schedule.
en-000012772	The assessed quota is based upon the donor country's portion of the world economy.
en-000012773	Goods are items that are tangible, such as books, pens, salt, shoes, hats and folders.
en-000012774	Services are activities provided by other people, such as doctors, lawn care workers, dentists, barbers, waiters, or online servers.
en-000012775	Other, mainly Italian, 18th century economists maintained that all desired goods and services were productive.
en-000012776	The division of consumables into physical goods and intangible services is a simplification: these are not discrete categories.
en-000012777	Most business theorists see a continuum with pure service at one endpoint and pure commodity goods at the other.
en-000012778	For public sector contracting purposes in the European Union, electricity supply is actually defined as goods rather than services.
en-000012779	Goods are normally structural and can be transferred in an instant while services are delivered over a period of time.
en-000012780	Distinctions are made between goods and services in the context of international trade liberalization.
en-000012781	And international trade in services has tended to expand more rapidly than trade in goods.
en-000012782	Food Technology is a branch of food science that deals with the production processes that make foods.
en-000012783	Nicolas Appert’s development in 1810 of the canning process was a decisive event.
en-000012784	Besides research into wine spoilage, Pasteur researched the production of alcohol, vinegar, wines and beer, and the souring of milk.
en-000012785	He developed pasteurization—the process of heating milk and milk products to destroy food spoilage and disease-producing organisms.
en-000012786	In his research into food technology, Pasteur became the pioneer into bacteriology and of modern preventive medicine.
en-000012787	Developments in food technology have contributed greatly to the food supply and have changed our world.
en-000012788	Our world has changed vastly over the past century – and not only because of technology.
en-000012789	In the past, consumer attitude towards food technologies was not common talk and was not important in food development.
en-000012790	That is why consumer acceptance of food technologies is an important question.
en-000012791	However, in these days acceptance of food products very often depends on potential benefits and risks associated with the food.
en-000012792	Especially innovative food processing technologies are connected to these characteristics and are perceived as risky by consumers
en-000012793	Whereas pasteurisation is well recognised, high pressure treatment or even microwaves are perceived as risky very often.
en-000012794	In studies done within Hightech Europe project, it was found that traditional technologies were well accepted in contrast to innovative technologies.
en-000012795	Consumers form their attitude towards innovative food technologies by three main factors mechanisms.
en-000012796	First, knowledge or beliefs about risks and benefits which are correlated with the technology.
en-000012797	Second, attitudes are based on their own experience and third, based on higher order values and beliefs.
en-000012798	Acceptance of innovative technologies can be improved by providing non-emotional and concise information about these new technological processes methods.
en-000012799	There are two bodies, consisting each of twelve jurats, for the Bailiwicks of Jersey and of Guernsey respectively.
en-000012800	They form, with the Bailiff as presiding judge, the Royal Court in each Bailiwick.
en-000012801	However, in Alderney, Jurats are appointed by the Crown, following a recommendation from the President of Alderney.
en-000012802	In Jersey, the power to raise excise duties was exercised by the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats.
en-000012803	In 1948 the jurats were replaced in the legislature by directly-elected senators.
en-000012804	Jurats now serve until retirement (at 72) as non-professional judges of fact (though not of law).
en-000012805	They also determine sentences in criminal matters and assess damages in civil matters.
en-000012806	Only the Superior Number can impose sentences of imprisonment of more than four years.
en-000012807	The Superior Number also acts as a court of first appeal in respect of sentences handed down by the Inferior Number.
en-000012808	From 2010 to 2013, 436 death sentences were handed down by lower courts.
en-000012809	Thereafter, any appeal would be heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council sitting in London.
en-000012810	The robes of jurats are purple (although the precise shade has varied).
en-000012811	The court of Alderney consists of six Jurats (appointed by the Crown) and the Judge of Alderney.
en-000012812	The party quickly became the nation's leading opposition party but was barred from the 2000 parliamentary elections.
en-000012813	However, since the party was barred its members formed a bloc with the Democratic Movement of Kyrgyzstan.
en-000012814	In 2001 the party formed the People's Congress of Kyrgyzstan an electoral alliance with three other opposition parties.
en-000012815	The prospect that the Party could come to power in an electoral alliance with the Socialists struck fear in opponents.
en-000012816	However, in 2004 the party joined the For Fair Elections alliance, in preparation for the February 2005 parliamentary elections.
en-000012817	The definition of apostasy from Islam and its appropriate punishment are controversial, and they vary among Islamic scholars.
en-000012818	In the late 1800s, the use of criminal penalties for apostasy fell into disuse, although civil penalties were still applied.
en-000012819	Some consider apostasy in Islam to be some form of religious crime, although others do not.
en-000012820	Twenty-three Muslim-majority countries, as of 2013, additionally covered apostasy in Islam through their criminal laws.
en-000012821	In contrast to the Qur'an, some hadith refer to punishments for apostasy.
en-000012822	For example, in the two Sahihs, the most trusted books in Sunni Islam after Quran, punishments for apostasy are described:
en-000012823	There are many other Sunni Islamic hadith that describe capital punishments for apostasy in Islam.
en-000012824	A person is considered apostate if he or she converts from Islam to another religion.
en-000012825	Apostasy can occur even if one does not formally renounce Islam.
en-000012826	Evidence of apostasy in Islam, according to Sunni Shafi'i school of jurisprudence (Fiqh), includes:
en-000012827	Al-Ghazali held that apostasy occurs when a Muslim denies the essential dogmas: monotheism, Muhammad's prophecy, and the Last Judgment.
en-000012828	In early Islamic history, after Muhammad's death, the declaration of Prophethood by anyone was automatically deemed to be proof of apostasy.
en-000012829	Some in Shafi'i fiqh such as Nawawi and al-Misri state that the apostasy code applies to a Muslim who
en-000012830	Maliki scholars additionally require that the person in question has publicly engaged in the obligatory practices of the religion.
en-000012831	However, proselytization and apostasy of Muslims to leave Islam and join another religion is considered a religious crime by many writers.
en-000012832	Throughout the history of Islam, proselytization of non-Muslims was recommended, while proselytization and apostasy of Muslims forbidden by law.
en-000012833	There are differences of opinion among Islamic scholars about whether, when and how apostasy in Islam should be punished.
en-000012834	Medieval Islamic scholars also differed on the punishment of a female apostate: death, enslavement, or imprisonment until repentance.
en-000012835	Abu Hanifa and his followers refused the death penalty for female apostates, supporting imprisonment until they re-embrace Islam.
en-000012836	Hanafi scholars maintain that a female apostate should not be killed because it was forbidden to kill women under Sharia.
en-000012837	Despite claiming to have received death threats, Edip Yuksel also believes that high-profile apostates who are controversial should be killed.

en-000012846	He concludes that moderates do not believe that there is any punishment that attaches to apostasy.
en-000012847	W. Heffening states that "in the Qur'an the apostate is threatened with punishment in the next world only."
en-000012848	Wael Hallaq holds that nothing in the law governing apostate and apostasy derives from the letter of Quran.
en-000012849	Otherwise, Islam prohibits spying on people and investigating their private lives, beliefs and personal opinions.

en-000012851	The charge of apostasy is often used by religious authorities to condemn and punish skeptics, dissidents, and minorities in their communities.
en-000012852	From the earliest history of Islam, the crime of apostasy and execution for apostasy has driven major events in Islam.
en-000012853	The apostasy wars split the two major sects of Islam- Sunni and Shia, and caused numerous deaths.

en-000012856	In the 8th century, the founder of Hanifi fiqh of jurisprudence in Islam, Abū Ḥanīfa, was charged with apostasy and punished.
en-000012857	Other sources say that executions of apostates have been "rare in Islamic history".
en-000012858	He was not executed because the Shafi'ite judge had ruled that his words were not "proof of disbelief.")
en-000012859	The accused were for the most part unmolested, and some even held high offices in the Muslim state.
en-000012860	As the rules and penalties of the Muslim law were systematized and more regularly enforced, charges of apostasy became rarer."
en-000012861	During the colonial era, death for apostasy was abolished in many Muslim-majority colonies.

en-000012864	In Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Yemen apostasy laws have been used to charge persons for acts other than conversion.
en-000012865	In addition, some Islamic countries without laws specifically addressing apostasy have prosecuted individuals or minorities for apostasy using broadly-defined blasphemy laws.
en-000012866	More broadly, the US should stop using countries like Syria as proxies against Iran.
en-000012867	This principle has been used in countries such as Egypt, Pakistan and others to bring blasphemy charges against apostates.
en-000012868	Similar views are expressed by the non-theistic International Humanist and Ethical Union.
en-000012869	These values do not include Muslims who may not support sharia but do support the death penalty for apostasy.
en-000012870	Article 1 of the Afghan Penal Code requires hudud crimes be punished per Hanafi religious jurisprudence.
en-000012871	Prevailing Hanafi jurisprudence, per consensus of its school of Islamic scholars, prescribes death penalty for the crime of apostasy.

en-000012892	However, Malaysia's constitution grants its states ("Negeri") the power to create and enforce laws relating to Islamic matters and Muslim community.
en-000012893	In these states, apostasy is defined as conversion from Islam to another faith, but converting to Islam is not a crime.
en-000012894	The state laws of Malaysia allow apostates of other religion to become Muslim without any equivalent review or process.
en-000012895	Its law provides a provision where the guilty is given the opportunity to repent and return to Islam within three days.

en-000012997	The neo-classical model was an extension to the 1946 Harrod–Domar model that included a new term: productivity growth.
en-000012998	Solow's model fitted available data on US economic growth with some success.
en-000012999	In 1987 Solow was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work.
en-000013000	Today, economists use Solow's sources-of-growth accounting to estimate the separate effects on economic growth of technological change, capital, and labor.
en-000013001	These refinements allow increasing capital intensity to be distinguished from technological progress.
en-000013002	With capital intensity increasing significantly faster than labor productivity in China, the inefficiency of investment is clear.
en-000013003	The change in the capital investment is from the change in the savings rate.
en-000013004	The standard Solow model predicts that in the long run, growth is achievable only through technological progress.
en-000013005	To allow a continued growth condition in the long-term the Solow Romer model is used.
en-000013006	The key assumption of the neoclassical growth model is that capital is subject to diminishing returns in a closed economy.
en-000013007	This residual measures the exogenous increase in total factor productivity (TFP) during a particular time period.
en-000013008	The model can be reformulated in slightly different ways using different productivity assumptions, or different measurement metrics:
en-000013009	(Therefore, measuring in ALP terms increases the apparent capital deepening effect.)
en-000013010	The textbook Solow–Swan model is set in continuous-time world with no government or international trade.
en-000013011	where formula_4 denotes time, formula_5 is the elasticity of output with respect to capital, and formula_6 represents total production.
en-000013012	formula_7 refers to labor-augmenting technology or“knowledge”, thus formula_8 represents effective labor.
en-000013013	All factors of production are fully employed, and initial values formula_9, formula_10, and formula_11 are given.
en-000013014	labor, as well as the level of technology grow exogenously at rates formula_12 and formula_13, respectively:
en-000013015	The number of effective units of labor, formula_16, therefore grows at rate formula_17.
en-000013016	Meanwhile, the stock of capital depreciates over time at a constant rate formula_18.
en-000013017	However, only a fraction of the output (formula_19 with formula_20) is consumed, leaving a saved share formula_21 for investment:
en-000013018	where formula_23 is shorthand for formula_24, the derivative with respect to time.
en-000013019	Since the production function formula_25 has constant returns to scale, it can be written as output per effective unit of labour:
en-000013020	The main interest of the model is the dynamics of capital intensity formula_27, the capital stock per unit of effective labour.
en-000013021	Its behaviour over time is given by the key equation of the Solow–Swan model:
en-000013022	The second term, formula_32, is the“break-even investment”: the amount of investment that must be invested to prevent formula_27 from falling.
en-000013023	at which the stock of capital formula_2 and effective labour formula_8 are growing at rate formula_40.
en-000013024	By assumption of constant returns, output formula_41 is also growing at that rate.
en-000013025	In essence, the Solow–Swan model predicts that an economy will converge to a balanced-growth equilibrium, regardless of its starting point.
en-000013026	In this situation, the growth of output per worker is determined solely by the rate of technological progress.
en-000013027	Therefore, at the equilibrium, the capital/output ratio depends only on savings, growth, and depreciation rates.
en-000013028	This is the Solow–Swan model's version of the Golden rule savings rate.
en-000013029	The basic Solow model cannot explain why productivity is lower in these countries.
en-000013030	Lucas suggested that lower levels of human capital in poor countries could explain the lower productivity.
en-000013031	so that formula_56 is the fraction of income appropriated by capital.
en-000013032	Thus, Solow–Swan model assumes from the beginning that the labor-capital split of income remains constant.
en-000013033	Similar to the textbook Solow–Swan model, the production function is of Cobb–Douglas type:
en-000013034	where formula_58 is the stock of human capital, which depreciates at the same rate formula_18 as physical capital.
en-000013035	For simplicity, they assume the same function of accumulation for both types of capital.
en-000013036	The balanced (or steady-state) equilibrium growth path is determined by formula_64, which means formula_65 and formula_66.
en-000013037	The external effect of human capital on the productivity of physical capital is evident in the marginal product of physical capital:
en-000013038	This insight significantly strengthens the case for the Mankiw, Romer, and Weil version of the Solow–Swan model.
en-000013039	The exogenous rate of TFP (total factor productivity) growth in the Solow–Swan model is the residual after accounting for capital accumulation.
en-000013040	The observed convergence in these states is also consistent with the conditional convergence concept.
en-000013041	Whether absolute convergence between countries or regions occurs depends on whether they have similar characteristics, such as:
en-000013042	Instead world productivity appears to have increased relatively steadily since the 19th century.
en-000013043	In the American Civil War, there were a few women who cross-dressed as men in order to fight.
en-000013044	Fighting on the battlefront in disguise was not the only way women involved themselves in war.
en-000013045	As increasing numbers of countries begin to expand the role of women in their militaries, the debate continues.
en-000013046	Thousands of women served as nurses and in other support roles in the major armies.
en-000013047	The only nation to deploy female combat troops in substantial numbers was Russia.
en-000013048	From the outset, female recruits either joined up in disguise or were tacitly accepted by their units.
en-000013049	The most prominent were a contingent of front-line light cavalry in a Cossack regiment commanded by a female colonel.
en-000013050	Over 500,000 had combat roles in anti-aircraft units in Britain and Germany, and front-line units in Russia.
en-000013051	Women had a well-publicized role in handling anti-aircraft guns against German planes and V-1 missiles.
en-000013052	The Third Reich, contrary to popular belief, had similar roles for women.
en-000013053	Women also served in auxiliary units in the navy (Kriegshelferinnen), air force (Luftnachrichtenhelferinnen) and army (Nachrichtenhelferin).
en-000013054	In 1944-45 roughly 500,000 women were volunteer uniformed auxiliaries in the German armed forces (Wehrmacht).
en-000013055	In the Luftwaffe they served in combat roles helping to operate the anti—aircraft systems that shot down Allied bombers.

en-000013278	Under flexible exchange rates, the exchange rate is the third endogenous variable while BoP is set equal to zero.
en-000013279	In contrast, under fixed exchange rates "e" is exogenous and the balance of payments surplus is determined by the model.
en-000013280	Under both types of exchange rate regime, the nominal domestic money supply "M" is exogenous, but for different reasons.
en-000013281	Under flexible exchange rates, the nominal money supply is completely under the control of the central bank.
en-000013282	In a system of flexible exchange rates, central banks allow the exchange rate to be determined by market forces alone.
en-000013283	An increase in money supply shifts the LM curve to the right.
en-000013284	This directly reduces the local interest rate relative to the global interest rate.
en-000013285	A decrease in the money supply causes the exact opposite process.
en-000013286	An increase in government expenditure shifts the IS curve to the right.
en-000013287	The shift causes both the local interest rate and income (GDP) to rise.
en-000013288	An increase in the global interest rate shifts the BoP curve upward and causes capital flows out of the local economy.
en-000013289	This depreciates the local currency and boosts net exports, shifting the IS curve to the right.
en-000013290	When the latter goes up, the BoP curve shifts upward by the same amount, and stays there.
en-000013291	A decrease in the global interest rate causes the reverse to occur.
en-000013292	Under the fixed exchange rate system, the central bank operates in the foreign exchange market to maintain a specific exchange rate.
en-000013293	This keeps the domestic currency's exchange rate at its targeted level.
en-000013294	In the very short run the money supply is normally predetermined by the past history of international payments flows.
en-000013295	But under perfect capital mobility, any such sterilization would be met by further offsetting international flows.
en-000013296	However, the exchange rate is controlled by the local monetary authority in the framework of a fixed exchange rate system.
en-000013297	In the end, the interest rate stays the same but the general income in the economy increases.
en-000013298	If the global interest rate increases, shifting the BoP curve upward, capital flows out to take advantage of the opportunity.
en-000013299	Once again, the LM curve plays a passive role, and the outcomes are determined by the IS-BoP interaction.
en-000013300	If the global interest rate declines below the domestic rate, the opposite occurs.
en-000013301	Results for a large open economy, on the other hand, can be consistent with those predicted by the IS-LM model.
en-000013302	The reason is that a large open economy has the characteristics of both an autarky and a small open economy.
en-000013303	But in the Mundell–Fleming open economy model with perfect capital mobility, monetary policy becomes ineffective.
en-000013304	One of the assumptions of the Mundell–Fleming model is that domestic and foreign securities are perfect substitutes.
en-000013305	However, in reality, the world interest rate is different from the domestic rate.
en-000013306	Rüdiger Dornbusch considered how exchange rate expectations made an effect on the exchange rate.
en-000013307	and if the elasticity of expectations formula_12, is less than unity, then we have
en-000013308	Since domestic output is formula_14, the differentiation of income with regard to the exchange rate becomes
en-000013309	Investment and consumption increase as the interest rates decrease, and currency depreciation improves the trade balance.
en-000013310	Then the total differentiations of trade balance and the demand for money are derived.
en-000013311	The denominator is positive, and the numerator is positive or negative.
en-000013312	Thus, a monetary expansion, in the short run, does not necessarily improve the trade balance.
en-000013313	In the short run, the eurozone needs much looser monetary and fiscal policy.
en-000013314	This is a consequence of introducing exchange rate expectations which the MF theory ignores.
en-000013315	He adds that, in the short run, fiscal policy works because it raises interest rates and the velocity of money.
en-000013316	Similarly, any regionally prominent science or engineering school is likely to be called "the MIT of" that region.
en-000013317	Senator Richard Shelby (R-Alabama) touted the University of Alabama in Huntsville as a possible "MIT of the South."
en-000013318	The Georgia Institute of Technology has also been called "the MIT of the South".
en-000013319	Other examples, make "X is the MIT of Y" an example of a snowclone (a family of formulaic clichés).
en-000013320	(MIT can also be a comparative or a metaphor for intellect in general: "Would they think of"that " at MIT?").
en-000013321	James Burke's television series "The Day the Universe Changed" (1985) employs the same technique for a more academic purpose.
en-000013322	This city, which hosted the second-oldest Italian university after Bologna, boasted a large concentration of intellectuals.
en-000013323	In Burke's phrase, Padua was "the MIT of the fifteenth century."
en-000013324	An episode of his later series "Connections 2" (1994) uses a similar shorthand to characterize the seventeenth-century Royal Society.
en-000013325	Co-creator and Executive Producer Cheryl Heuton says,"We originally tried to choose MIT for the show.
en-000013326	Dylan Bruno, the actor who plays Colby Granger, has earned a bachelor's degree in environmental engineering from MIT.
en-000013327	Films set at MIT are less common than those that use the MIT name as metaphor.
en-000013328	An incidental scene in "The Friends of Eddie Coyle" (1973) was shot on location outside of MIT Baker House.
en-000013329	A scene in "A Small Circle of Friends" (1980) was shot in Walker Memorial, an MIT cafeteria and gymnasium.
en-000013330	The movie setting portrays Harvard University, but Harvard declined to allow the filming on their campus.
en-000013331	Some cinematic references to MIT betray a mild anti-intellectualism, or at least a lack of respect for "book learning".
en-000013332	In "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" (2000), a background image of Whassamatta U. is recognizable as a main MIT building.
en-000013333	revolves around an 11-year-old student who graduated from MIT and travels to Japan to become a high school teacher.
en-000013334	The CIA character "Ed Hoffman" in the film "Body of Lies" can be seen wearing an MIT shirt in multiple shots.
en-000013335	Individual characters in single episodes of television series are often announced as MIT graduates.
en-000013336	MIT was also mentioned in the pilot episode of'Gilmore Girls'.
en-000013337	After campaigning on-air for years, they were finally invited to speak at MIT's 1999 commencement exercise.
en-000013338	Nonfiction works have examined MIT, its history, and its various subcultures.
en-000013339	Patricia Vasquez visits (or comes from) MIT in Greg Bear's "Eon" (1985).
en-000013340	Ayn Rand's novel "The Fountainhead" begins with architecture student Howard Roark being expelled from the fictional "Stanton Institute of Technology".
en-000013341	Jhumpa Lahiri's "The Namesake" features a character, Ashoke, who received his PhD in Fiber Optics from MIT.
en-000013342	"Geeks& Greeks" (2016) is a semi-autobiographical graphic novel by Steve Altes and Andy Fish, set at MIT.
en-000013343	The story was inspired by MIT's hacking culture and Altes's experiences with fraternity hazing.
en-000013344	MIT is a recurring motif in the works of Kurt Vonnegut, much like the planet Tralfamadore or the Vietnam War.
en-000013345	His older brother, another Bernard, earned a bachelor's and a PhD in chemistry, also at MIT.
en-000013346	Speaking of the role religion plays in modern society, Vonnegut notes:
en-000013347	The state plays a central role in modern society, and rightly so.
en-000013348	Kurt Vonnegut was friends with fellow humanist and writer Isaac Asimov, who resided for many years in Newton, Massachusetts.
en-000013349	In his copious autobiographical writings, Asimov reveals a mild predilection for the Institute's architecture, and an awareness of its aesthetic possibilities.
en-000013350	Asimov's work, too, trades on MIT's reputation for narrative effect, even touching upon an anti-academic theme.
en-000013351	Since 1983, science fiction writer Joe Haldeman has been an Adjunct Professor teaching writing at MIT, and knows the institution well.
en-000013352	The book begins with MIT student Matt Fuller accidentally discovering the time machine of the title.
en-000013353	In all time periods, under vastly differing circumstances, the protagonist becomes an MIT full professor.
en-000013354	In "Doonesbury," Kim Rosenthal almost earned her PhD in computer science, dropping out because it was "too easy."
en-000013355	In the fall of 2006, Kim and Mike Doonesbury's daughter Alex entered MIT as a freshman.
en-000013356	Bill Amend's "FoxTrot" has also made MIT allusions, in keeping with the strip's genial satire of nerd subcultures.
en-000013357	The first volume of instructions begins, ""Assembly Instructions "—"Step 1:" Obtain a master's degree in mechanical engineering from M.I.T.
en-000013358	Some genres of computer and video games have characterization requirements like those of movies.
en-000013359	This character's background would typically have to be established very quickly and efficiently, perhaps within one screen of introductory text.
en-000013360	Stating that a commando or top-secret operative "graduated from MIT" is one way to accomplish this.
en-000013361	Tech's class ring is known as the "brass hyrax", parodying MIT's Brass Rat.
en-000013362	In the "Fallout" games MIT is known as the "Commonwealth Institute of Technology".
en-000013363	The Institute is featured as a major faction in the 2015 title, "Fallout 4".
en-000013364	This lyric can be taken literally, or it can be read metaphorically as a description of MIT student culture.
en-000013365	Allan Sherman's paean to initialisms, "Harvey and Sheila," notes that Harvey "works for IBM; he went to MIT, got his PhD."
en-000013366	mentions MIT in the song "Born Not To Know," from their 1988 debut album "Who?"
en-000013367	In the song, a pretentious individual rattles off a long list of his impressive academic credentials—culminating with a"Ph.
en-000013368	D from MIT "—only to then ask,"so, can I get a job?"
en-000013369	He speaks of taking revenge for the death of a friend, part of his Cambridge, UK crew:
en-000013370	Over the years, the students and faculty of MIT have produced their own share of musical material.
en-000013371	This experience led him to write a song called "Sociology," played to the tune of Irving Berlin's "Choreography."
en-000013372	Students have also written their own songs during their tenures at the Institute.
en-000013373	This tradition, which goes back at least to The Doormat Singers of the 1960s, continues with several present-day groups.
en-000013374	Education in Sudan is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 13 years.
en-000013375	Primary education consists of eight years, followed by three years of secondary education.
en-000013376	The former educational ladder 6 + 3 + 3 was changed in 1990.
en-000013377	In 2001 the World Bank estimated that primary enrollment was 46 percent of eligible pupils and 21 percent of secondary students.
en-000013378	The literacy rate is 70.2% of total population, male: 79.6%, female: 60.8%.
en-000013379	These taught Islamic studies, arithmetic, and the Arabic and Turkish languages.
en-000013380	The schools were all destroyed during the Mahdist period between 1881-1898.
en-000013381	These taught little more than the memorisation of the Koran, and even these were disrupted by the disorders before 1898.
en-000013382	They made efforts to reopen as many "kuttabs" as possible, by giving subsidies to teachers.
en-000013383	Instructional workshops were set up at Kassala, Omdurman, and at the Gordon College.
en-000013384	But higher class Sudanese refused to send their children to these workshops.
en-000013385	In the 1930s and 1940s there was an expansion in secondary schools in the northern Sudan.
en-000013386	In 1938 the decision was taken to provide post-secondary schooling, leading towards the establishment of a university.
en-000013387	In 1944 these schools were amalgamated to form a university, offering degrees equivalent to a United Kingdom degree.
en-000013388	The Christian missionary societies were allowed to establish schools in the south, but not in the north.
en-000013389	Up to 1922, the development of schools in the south was entirely in the hands of the missionaries.
en-000013390	In 1922 the government began to give some financial assistance to the missionary schools, and substantially increased it from 1926.
en-000013391	Education was in local languages at primary level, and in English at higher level.
en-000013392	In 1947 there were 70,457 students at government schools and 14,369 students and non-government schools in the north.
en-000013393	The school system was in good shape at independence, and the new government continued to create new schools and universities.
en-000013394	In 1989 there were five public universities and two private universities in Sudan.
en-000013395	A Moslem curriculum was devised and imposed on all schools, colleges and universities.
en-000013396	It consisted of two parts, the first obligatory for all students and the second optional.
en-000013397	All the essential elements of the obligatory course would be drawn from the Quran and the recognized books of the hadith.
en-000013398	The optional course of study would permit the student to select certain specializations according to individual aptitudes and inclinations.
en-000013399	Within a year the government ordered that Arabic should be used as the language of instruction, replacing English.
en-000013400	It also dismissed around seventy faculty members of the University of Khartoum, who were opposed to the new policy.
en-000013401	It also ordered that the number of university students should be doubled, and that many new universities should be opened.
en-000013402	By 2006 there were 27 public universities, 5 private universities, 9 public technical colleges, and 46 private colleges.
en-000013403	Total tertiary enrollment in 2000 was 204,114 students, of which 47% were female.
en-000013404	In Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, there are four main levels of education.
en-000013405	It begins in the age of 3-4, consists of 1-2 grades, (depending on the parents).
en-000013406	By the 8th grade a student is 13–14 years old ready to take the certificate exams and entering high school.
en-000013407	At this level the school methods add some main academic subjects such as chemistry, biology, physics, geography, etc...
en-000013408	After all, the education system in Sudan went through many changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
en-000013409	By the late 1990s, the Japanese banking system was offering companies loans at near-zero interest rates.
en-000013410	It originates in a school for girls created in 1907 by Sheikh Babiker Badri, the grandfather of the current president.
en-000013411	The Sheikh saw that educating women was essential to improve nutrition, health, childcare and community development.
en-000013412	After an inspection by Currie, then minister of education in the condominium government, the school received state funding.
en-000013413	It was only in 1940 that the first intermediate school for girls, the Omdurman Girls'Intermediate School, opened.
en-000013414	In 1966 Yusuf Badri, Babiker's son and the father of the current president, established Ahfad University College for Women.
en-000013415	The two faculties at the university were Family Sciences (with an emphasis on nutrition education) and Psychology and Preschool education.
en-000013416	By 1990 it had evolved as the premier women's university college in Sudan with an enrollment of 1,800.
en-000013417	It had a mixture of academic and practical programs, such as those that educated women to teach in rural areas.
en-000013418	There are a number of local NGOs that are working in the field of education in Sudan.
en-000013419	The most prominent is the Sudanese Organization for Education Development, which focuses on basic education.
en-000013420	The creation of the office of HCNM was directly related to the political circumstances at the beginning of the 1990s.
en-000013421	Efforts of the CSCE, European Union and United Nations failed to bring peace.
en-000013422	This office would aim to prevent conflicts based on tensions with ethnic minorities.
en-000013423	This often meant that tensions escalated because the international community did not fully understand the issues at play.
en-000013424	The Yugoslav conflict also made clear that many conflicts around the world were rooted in tensions involving national minorities.
en-000013425	It was against this background that the proposal for the office of the HCNM was presented.
en-000013426	Many concerns were raised in regards to the model put forward by the Netherlands.
en-000013427	As a result, several major restrictions to the HCNM’s role were implemented into the mandate.
en-000013428	States disagreed on whether the rights of national minorities were individual or group rights.
en-000013429	Ultimately, there was a clear exclusion of individual cases through paragraph 5(c) of the HCNM mandate.
en-000013430	Many states feared that the HCNM would become a sort of "ombudsman" for national minorities.
en-000013431	The aim of the office was not to create a new human rights instrument, but to create a conflict prevention tool.
en-000013432	This was emphasised in the title of the office: the High Commissioner "on" National Minorities, not "for" National Minorities.
en-000013433	Many states were also highly opposed to involvement by the HCNM in cases of terrorism.
en-000013434	As a result, the HCNM was prohibited from considering‘national minority issues in situations involving organized acts of terrorism’.
en-000013435	In some instances this clause has become a way for states to ban the HCNM from interferring with their minority problems.
en-000013436	No clear guidance was given in the mandate on how to interpret this term.
en-000013437	The first High Commissioner, Max van der Stoel, focused on clarifying and defining his mandate.
en-000013438	Through the broadly defined mandate, he was able to approach the role in the best way he saw fit.
en-000013439	The approach taken by van der Stoel came to define how his successors approached the role too.
en-000013440	Firstly, a national minority could be distinguished from the rest of society through linguistic, ethnic or cultural characteristics.
en-000013441	Secondly, that minority strived to protect and strengthen those characteristics which made up its identity.
en-000013442	The first is cultural: to protect and strengthen the identity of the Scottish people.
en-000013443	In many cases a national minority will be a majority in certain countries or regions.
en-000013444	The main role of the HCNM is to identify and address tensions involving national minorities which could develop into a conflict.
en-000013445	This involves“early warning” of potential conflict followed by“early action” to dissolve tensions.
en-000013446	This involves mediation as well as the introduction of sustainable solutions.
en-000013447	Ultimately, the role of the High Commissioner is one of preventative diplomacy.
en-000013448	She must provide early warnings of escalating tensions as well as early action to prevent any further escalation.
en-000013449	Tensions between different societal groups can arise over a variety of elements, such as ethnicity, religion, or language.
en-000013450	The HCNM works to sort through these tensions and towards social cohesion, before those tensions escalate into conflicts.
en-000013451	Where conflicts can only be resolved in the long term, a more comprehensive approach must be taken.
en-000013452	In order to promote social cohesion, the HCNM must provide advice and take actions that are context specific.
en-000013453	Significant research should be undertaken about the specific society and ethnic groups involved in order to effectively respond to the situation.
en-000013454	The work undertaken by the High Commissioners since the inception of the role is considered to have been largely successful.
en-000013455	The role requires expertise, tools and experience in monitoring situations of potential tension, as well as in recognising signs of escalation.
en-000013456	No inter-ethnic tension is alike, and each will involve different factors and historical and cultural influences.
en-000013457	There is therefore a clear need for a dedicated office specialised in and focused on minority issues.
en-000013458	The HCNM employs several different techniques in order to achieve her purpose of conflict prevention.
en-000013459	The High Commissioner works very closely with the particular state involved and with the leaders of the relevant parties.
en-000013460	While the HCNM ultimately cannot enforce any compulsory action, there are many ways that the HCNM can assist the situation.
en-000013461	She may also assist in implementing those standards and helping them become the norm in that state.
en-000013462	There are seven sets of thematic recommendations that can provide a platform for better inter-ethnic relations and help to reduce tension.
en-000013463	This involves integration policies such as encouragement to learn the state language.
en-000013464	The High Commissioner also promotes education of national minority languages and religious practices as a way to prevent conflict.
en-000013465	This is a way to foster an appreciation of diversity among communities and also to dissolve stereotypes about certain ethnic groups.
en-000013466	This involves assisting processes of negotiations and ensuring participation by all relevant parties.
en-000013467	When creating the role, it was recognised that the most frequent cause of hostile inter-ethnic relations was insufficient or distorted communication.
en-000013468	The HCNM plays an important role in setting up lines of effective communication before hostile relations begin to develop.
en-000013469	In such a circumstance, the HCNM is to inform the OSCE.
en-000013470	His work during this time was considered largely successful in reducing tensions and building towards peaceful solutions.
en-000013471	This conflict was multi layered and emphasised the importance of finding durable solutions in the search for peace.
en-000013472	The HCNM was invited to the Ukraine by the government in February 1994.
en-000013473	In Ukraine at that time there were several minority issues that were causing tension.
en-000013474	However, while the HCNM’s work was largely successful, it also exposed the limitations of the role.
en-000013475	Brownfield status is a legal designation which places restrictions, conditions or incentives on redevelopment.
en-000013476	A strip of the Texaco lands in Mississauga is slated to be part of the Waterfront Trail.
en-000013477	The Port Hope, Ontario Port Hope, Ontario site has a liability of $1 billion.
en-000013478	There is also "$1.8 billion for general inventory sites" and"$200 million for other sites.
en-000013479	The federal government exercises some control over environmental protection, the"provincial and territorial governments issue the bulk of legislation regarding
en-000013480	The federal government would then augment the protection up to the once-in-five-hundred-year level.
en-000013481	Examples include the cleanup and redevelopment of former and current ship building facilities along Copenhagen’s historic waterfront.
en-000013482	Laws in Denmark require a higher degree of coordination of planning and reuse than is found in many other countries.
en-000013483	Germany loses greenfields at a rate of about 1.2 square kilometres per day for settlement and transportation infrastructure.
en-000013484	Each of the approximately 14,700 local municipalities is empowered to allocate lands for industrial and commercial use.
en-000013485	As a result, local control over reuse of brownfield sites in Germany is a critical factor in the reuse decision.
en-000013486	Cleanup laws in the UK are centered on the premise that the remediation should be "fit for the purpose".
en-000013487	It was dislodged from its mother party in 1934 due to its pro-Nazi stance.
en-000013488	It was then reconstructed as a separate political party, the National League of Sweden.
en-000013489	After the Second World War, the political fortunes of the group dwindled.
en-000013490	SNU was founded on October 16, 1915 at Hotell Kronprinsen in Stockholm.
en-000013491	The organisation, though never formally recognized, became the youth referent of the General Electoral Union.
en-000013492	The radicalization was accentuated by the election of Elmo Lindholm as the SNU chairman.
en-000013493	In 1931 the organization had 35 460 members, and was steadily growing.
en-000013494	The League supported the German Nazis after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933.
en-000013495	The 1930s saw many harsh conflicts within the Conservative movement in Sweden on how to relate to the emerging Nazism.
en-000013496	During 1933 the General Electoral Union arranged a number of demonstrations against both Nazism and communism.
en-000013497	Another issue of contention was whether there should have been any age limit for SNU membership.
en-000013498	SNU however refuted the idea of an age limit, as the organization wished to exert more political influence of its own.
en-000013499	In the General Electoral Union-SNU split, three conservative MPs sided with SNUoF.
en-000013500	These three parliamentarians formed their own independent faction within parliament, dubbed "Nationella Gruppen" (the "National Faction").
en-000013501	In 1934, the small pro-German National Labour League ("Nationella Arbetsförbundet") merged into SNUoF.
en-000013502	The group contested the 1935 municipal elections, gaining 70 seats throughout the country.
en-000013503	The same year the name was changed to National League of Sweden ("Sveriges Nationella Förbund").
en-000013504	With a mere 31 015 votes, the SNL did not win any seat in the parliament.
