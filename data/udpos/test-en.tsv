And
,
by
the
way

is
anybody
else
just
a
little
nostalgic
for
the

This
BuzzMachine
post
argues
that
Google
's
rush
toward
ubiquity
might
backfire
--
which
we
've
all
heard
before
,
but
it
's
particularly
well
-
put
in
this
post
.

Google
is
a
nice
search
engine
.

Does
anybody
use
it
for
anything
else
?

They
own
blogger
,
of
course
.

Is
that
a
money
maker
?

I
'm
staying
away
from
the
stock
.

I
doubt
the
very
few
who
actually
read
my
blog
have
not
come
across
this
yet
,
but
I
figured
I
would
put
it
out
there
anyways
.

John
Donovan
from
Argghhh!
has
put
out
a
excellent
slide
show
on
what
was
actually
found
and
fought
for
in
Fallujah
.

Click
here
To
view
it
.

He
makes
some
good
observations
on
a
few
of
the
pic's
.

One
of
the
pictures
shows
a
flag
that
was
found
in
Fallujah
.

On
the
next
two
pictures
he
took
screenshots
of
two
beheading
video's
.

Compare
the
flags
to
the
Fallujah
one
.

You
have
to
see
these
slides
....
they
are
amazing
.

This
Fallujah
operation
my
turn
out
to
be
the
most
important
operation
done
by
the
US
Military
since
the
end
of
the
war
.

Let
me
join
the
chorus
of
annoyance
over
Google
's
new
toolbar
,
which
,
as
noted
in
the
linked
article
,
commits
just
about
every
sin
an
online
marketer
could
commit
,
and
makes
up
a
few
new
ones
besides
.

I
'm
not
fond
of
the
Google
-
hates
-
privacy
argument

(
You
do
n't
need
to
use
their
site
,
you
can
opt
-
out
of
sharing
your
information
,
you
do
n't
need
to
send
stuff
to
anyone
with
a
Gmail

,
and
if
--
wonder
of
wonders
--
you
're
worried
that
you
might
send
something
to
someone
who
would
forward
an
excerpt
to
someone
who
would
then
store
it
on
a
Gmail
account
...
you
have
far
,
far
too
much
time
on
your
hands
)
.

However
,
this
toolbar
is
really
bad
news
.

On
the
other
hand
,
it
looks
pretty
cool
.

Iran
says
it
is
creating
nuclear
energy
without
wanting
nuclear
weapons
.

The
United
States
does
n't
believe
the
Iranian
Government
.

One
can
suspect
the
Iranian
Government
.

But
there
is
no
proof
.

I
read
an
Article
in
Time
magazine
accusing
the
Iranian
Government
of
being
willing
to
start
a
nuclear
war
and
I
sympathise
with
the
Article
.

They
are
certainly
being
nasty
to
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
in
connection
with
the
anti-proliferation
treaty
.

The
President
has
also
said
he
would
like
to
see
Israel
wiped
off
the
map
which
he
could
n't
even
begin
to
try
without
nuclear
weapons
.

But
he
has
insisted
that
he
wants
nuclear
power
for
peaceful
purposes
.

Many
people
want
to
use
diplomacy
with
Iran
rather
than
military
pressure
.

But
will
diplomacy
work
?

And
can
anyone
use
military
pressure
without
proof
?

One
reader
pointed
out
that
the
President
watched
the
Americans
in
the
embassy
when
they
took
them
hostage
.

He
has
denied
this
.

We
do
n't
have
to
believe
him
.

But
we
ca
n't
prove
it
.

It
does
seem
that
Iranians
frequently
make
statements
and
then
hide
behind
lack
of
proof
.

Angry
crowds
chanted
anti-American
slogans
in
the
western
city
of
Falluja
(
pop.
256,000
)
as
the
security
police
killed
in
a
friendly
fire
incident
by
US
troops
were
buried
on
Saturday
.

Reuters
reported
that
"
Sunni
clerics
in
the
town
issued
a
'
Declaration
by
the
people
of
Fallujah
'
condemning
the
deaths
of
the
security
guards
and
police
,
announcing
three
days
of
mourning
,
and
calling
for
a
general
strike
today
.
"

It
read
,
"
The
people
of
Fallujah
condemn
the
massacre
which
was
committed
on
Friday
against
people
dedicated
to
the
protection
of
Fallujah
.

Let
aggressive
(
American
)
leaders
and
soldiers
know
that
we
are
capable
of
protecting
the
city
's
security
and
safety
,
and
ask
them
to
lift
their
hands
from
the
city
.
"

The
clerics
demanded
talks
with
local
US
commanders
.

Falluja
has
long
been
roiled
by
tense
relations
with
the
US
soldiers
there
,
since
local
Sunnis
either
remain
committed
to
Arab
nationalism
or
have
become
Sunni
fundamentalists
or
even
radicals
.

Cities
such
as
Falluja
received
special
treatment
from
Saddam
and
enjoyed
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
country
's
wealth
and
power
.

They
know
that
the
American
advent
implies
for
them
a
demotion
,
and
an
elevation
of
the
Shiites
and
Kurds
,
and
they
refuse
to
go
quietly
.

I
rarely
agree

from

Important
news
such
as
President
Bush
's
miniscule
calibrations
on
his
marriage
amendment
/
anti-gay
(
update
:
he
's
not
against
gays
in
the
bedroom
,
just
at
the
altar
,
where
of
course
their
relationships
should
not
only
be
frowned
upon
but
should
be
constitutionally
excluded
)
has
pushed
Sudan
not
just
off
the
front
pages
,
or
the
A
section
,
but
out
of
the
NY
Times
and
Washington
Post
completely
.

I
had
to
go
to
the
BBC
for
this
report
.

It
's
symptomatic
,
I
suppose
,
of
our
fast
-
paced
,
24
hour
news
-
cycle
lives
,
that
the
biggest
short
-
term
humanitarian
crisis
in
the
world
would
quickly
be
eclipsed
,
once
our
Secretary
of
State
was
finished
with
his
whirlwind
tour
,
from
the
newspapers
.

It
's
just
disappointing
.

Most
troubling
,
however
,
is
the
fact
that
the
political
will
to
end
the
crisis
expressed
a
few
short
weeks
ago
seems
to
have
ebbed
.

At
that
time
,
UN
Secretary
General
Kofi
Annan
demanded
steps
be
taken
to
end
the
ethnic
violence
in
Darfur
within
48
hours
.

Two
weeks
later
,
and
the
violence
continues
.

The
African
Union
is
clearly
not
up
to
the
task
of
keeping
the
peace
,
pledging
300
troops
to
an
area
that
will
need
15,000
,
according
to
analysts
.

And
international
donors
have
given
only
half
of
the
relief
aid
that
Darfur
needs
,
according
to
the
local
UN
officials
.

So
hear
we
are
,
two
weeks
later
,
after
that
dazzling
PR
display
two
weeks
ago
by
Powell
and
Annan
,
and
the
situation
on
the
ground
in
Darfur
appears
basically
unchanged
.

Warren
Buffett
is
giving
away
85
%
of
his
wealth
,
mostly
to
the
Bill
and
Melinda
Gates
Foundation
.

It
's
a
move
that
really
worries
me
;
Buffett
's
usual
justification
for
keeping
most
of
his
money
was
that
he
was
still
compounding
the
value
of
his
fortune
at
a
pretty
high
rate
,
so
any
gifts
now
would
mean
significantly
less
money
for
the
foundation
later
.

It
's
a
little
hard
to
parse
,
but
at
this
point
his
ostensible
view
is
that
the
Gateses
are
very
good
money
-
redistributors
,
and
he
wants
them
to
have
the
money
as
soon
as
possible
.

Which
essentially
sounds
like
he
's
worried
that
Bill
or
Melinda
are
going
to
die
soon
.

I
assume
his
actual
reason
is
that
he
's
worried
that
Berkshire
Hathaway
just
ca
n't
grow
quickly
enough
to
justify
his
usual
charity
policy
.

I
'm
not
sure
how
the
market
will
react
.

It
does
n't
change
the
company
's
intrinsic
worth
,
and
as
the
article
notes
,
the
company
might
be
added
to
a
major
index
once
the
shares
get
more
liquid
.

On
the
other
hand
,
this
is
essentially
a
statement
that
the
company
is
overpriced
from
the
guy
who
knows
it
best
--
and
happens
to
be
the
best
investor
of
the
last
century
.

em
...
no
...
the
Gates
foundation
mainly
invests
in
medical
research
and
education
,
that
means
donating
now
adds
a
tremendous
value
compared
to
donating
in
ten
years
.

Because
the
10.000.000
people
dying
from
malaria
will
otherwise
be
dead
.

i.e
.

He
's
not
giving
85
%
away
,
he
's
giving
a
number
of
shares
each
year
that
decrease
in
number
at
the
rate
of
5
%
a
year
(
until
gone
?
)
.

He
mentions
his
wife
's
death
having
an
effect
on
him
.

It
sounds
pretty
rational
that
he
's
saying
that
Bill
and
Melinda
are
at
a
prime
spot
,
so
starting
the
money
hose
now
is
a
good
idea
,
but
Buffet
is
still
keeping
most
of
his
donation
inside
of
Berkshire
where
it
will
compound
.

Bill
over
at
The
Fourth
Rail
has
an
excellent
essay
on
how
the
MSM
and
the
UN
,
even
the
leftist
countries
in
Europe
,
are
basically
accepting
terrorist
organizations
as
legitimate
forms
of
a
political
party
:

On
the
same
day
Palestinians
protest
in
support
of
Hezbollah
and
Syria
,
the
terrorist
group
Hamas
has
indicated
it
will
participate
in
the
scheduled
upcoming
Parliamentary
elections
.

To
the
north
in
Lebanon
,
there
is
serious
debate
within
Hezbollah
about
entering
the
Lebanese
political
process
in
light
of
Syria
's
promised
withdrawal
.

Syria
has
agreed
to
withdraw
under
the
conditions
set
forth
in
UNSC
Resolution
1559
,
which
has
already
begun
.

UN
Secretary
-
General
Kofi
Annan
has
indicated
it
is
time
to
"
recognize
Hezbollah
"
after
easily
being
duped
by
"
the
message
on
the
placards
they
are
using
"
.

This
acceptance
of
blatantly
terrorist
groups
as
legitimate
freedom
movements
is
a
cancerous
tumor
on
the
United
Nations
and
the
media
.

Over
three
years
after
9-11
,
the
United
Nations
,
despite
their
attempts
to
project
strength
in
fighting
terrorism
,
still
can
not
properly
define
the
word
"
terrorist
"
,
waffling
over
the
issue
of
whether
the
murder
of
innocent
civilians
are
terrorist
acts
.

The
media
routinely
obscures
the
lines
between
terrorism
and
legitimate
resistance
,
as
the
recent
article
by
Daniel
Okrent
of
The
New
York
Times
demonstrates
.

...

The
decision
to
sidestep
the
obvious
to
satisfy
the
need
to
avoid
confrontation
does
not
bring
peace
,
but
only
delays
the
eventual
conflict
as
the
predators
of
Hamas
and
Hezbollah
exploit
the
inherent
weakness
of
the
internationals
and
the
media
.

I
've
been
fuming
over
this
fact
for
a
few
weeks
now
,
ever
since
some
organizations
and
governments
suggested
we
need
to
accept
the
fact
that
Hezbollah
will
get
involved
in
running
Lebanon
.

Wtf
is
this
?

This
is
a
terrorist
organization
plain
and
simple
.

This
is
the
organization
that
bombed
our
Marine
barracks
in
1983
,
took
Americans
hostage
throughout
the
80's
and
now
they
should
be
considered
a
legitimate
organization
?

This
is
just
another
reason
to
never
trust
the
MSM
,
and
certainly
not
the
Europeans
.

The
Iraqi
Islamic
Party
lead
by
Muhsin
Abdul
Hamid
,
has
been
among
the
few
Sunni
Muslim
groups
willing
to
cooperate
(
even
if
rather
lukewarmly
)
with
the
Americans
.

It
is
now
threatening
to
pull
out
of
the
Allawi
caretaker
government
.

The
IIP
had
also
been
the
main
force
urging
Sunni
Arabs
to
participate
in
the
elections
scheduled
for
January
,
and
had
been
opposed
in
this
stance
by
the
Association
of
Muslim
Scholars
.

That
the
Iraqi
Islamic
Party
is
now
contemplating
leaving
the
Allawi
government
raises
the
question
of
whether
a
mass
Sunni
Arab
boycott
of
the
elections
is
in
the
offing
,
thus
fatally
weakening
the
legitimacy
of
any
new
government
.

Az
-
Zaman
:
The
Association
of
Muslim
Scholars
forbade
Iraqis
to
participate
in
the
attack
on
Fallujah
with
the
Americans
.

In
a
communique
,
the
AMS
said
that
for
Iraqis
to
take
part
with
"
raiding
forces
"
in
the
assault
on
a
city
,
the
population
of
which
is
Muslim
(
such
as
Fallujah
)
would
be
considered
the
most
mortal
of
mortal
sins
.

The
Sunni
AMS
told
Iraqis
,
"
You
sinned
when
you
participated
with
occupation
forces
in
the
assault
on
Najaf
,
and
beware
lest
you
repeat
this
same
sin
in
Fallujah
.

Remember
that
the
Occupation
is
emphemeral
.
"

The
radical
Shiite
Sadr
movement
issued
a
statement
forbidding
the
participation
of
Iraqi
troops
in
the
attack
on
Fallujah
,
as
well
.

The
statement
said
,
"
We
direct
an
appeal
at
the
men
in
the
Iraqi
forces
,
whether
national
guards
or
others
,
the
majority
of
whom
are
Muslim
,
calling
upon
them
to
refrain
for
commiting
this
enormous
sin
under
the
banner
of
forces
that
do
not
respect
our
religion
or
any
principles
of
basic
humanity
,
and
we
ask
them
to
view
this
war
as
illegal
.
"

It
called
a
"
ploy
"
the
assertaion
that
the
attack
was
merely
on
foreign
fighters
at
Fallujah
.

The
convergence
of
views
among
the
more
militant
Sunni
Muslim
clerics
of
AMS
and
the
radical
Shiites
of
the
Sadr
movement
has
been
seen
before
,
last
spring
during
the
initial
US
assault
on
Fallujah
and
during
the
US
attack
on
Mahdi
Army
militiamen
in
Najaf
.

Most
Shiites
,
however
,
are
still
reluctant
to
take
major
risks
to
support
the
Sunnis
of
Fallujah
,
many
of
whom
had
supported
Saddam
and
his
anti-Shiite
pogroms
.

President
Bush
pinched
a
few
nerves
yesterday
with
his
choice
of
words
:

WASHINGTON
(
Reuters
)
-

U.S.
Muslim
groups
criticized
President
Bush
on
Thursday
for
calling
a
foiled
plot
to
blow
up
airplanes
part
of
a
"
war
with
Islamic
fascists
,
"
saying
the
term
could
inflame
anti-Muslim
tensions
.

U.S.
officials
have
said
the
plot
,
thwarted
by
Britain
,
to
blow
up
several
aircraft
over
the
Atlantic
bore
many
of
the
hallmarks
of
al
Qaeda
.

"
We
believe
this
is
an
ill
-
advised
term
and
we
believe
that
it
is
counterproductive
to
associate
Islam
or
Muslims
with
fascism
,
"
said
Nihad
Awad
,
executive
director
of
the
Council
on
American
-
Islamic
Relations
advocacy
group
.

Which
is
why
he
did
n't
say
we
're
at
war
with
Islamic
people
.

We
're
at
war
with
Islamic
fascists
.

By
using
the
word
"
Islamic
"
as
an
adjective
Bush
was
purposely
not
associating
Muslims
with
fascism
,
hence
the
qualifier
.

We
've
got
a
Steven
,
the
one
word
that
did
n't
crash
my
spell
-
check
,
despite
it
being
followed
by
a
Vikash
Chand
Abdul
Shakur
.

Folks
,
if
it
's
Islamic
,
and
fascist
,
it
's
an
Islamic
fascist
.

But
because
we
do
n't
want
to
sound
hateful
we
must
pretend
everyone
's
a
possible
suspect
and
make
airline
travel
more
miserable
than
it
's
ever
been
.

On
the
internet
site
of
Monotheism
and
Holy
War
(
al
-
Tawhid
wa
al
-
Jihad
)
,
the
group
allegedly
declared
,
"
We
announce
that
the
Tawhid
and
Jihad
Group
,
its
prince
and
soldiers
,
have
pledged
allegiance
to
the
sheikh
of
the
mujahideen
Osama
bin
Laden
.
"

This
pledge
is
a
new
development
.

Abu
Musab
al
-
Zarqawi
and
his
group
are
said
to
have
been
bitter
rivals
of
al
-
Qaeda
during
the
Afghan
resistance
days
.

One
witness
at
the
Moutasaddiq
trial
in
Germany
alleged
that
Zarqawi
had
not
allowed
Monotheism
and
Holy
War
to
share
resources
with
al
-
Qaeda
in
the
early
zeroes
of
the
21st
century
.

If
the
statement
is
true
,
it
is
a
worrying
sign
that
even
the
divided
small
radical
guerrilla
groups
are
being
"
picked
up
"
by
al
-
Qaeda
.

This
consolidation
is
obviously
a
result
of
Bush
's
aggressive
invasion
of
Iraq
and
of
the
botching
of
the
aftermath
.

It
is
a
setback
for
the
war
on
terror
.

Al
-
Qaeda
in
Afghanistan
was
a
group
of
only
a
few
hundred
"
Afghan
Arabs
"
who
pledged
personal
loyalty
to
Usamah
Bin
Laden
.

It
could
notionally
be
expanded
to
encompass
the
5,000
-
strong
"
55th
Brigade
"
of
the
Taliban
regime
,
though
this
is
not
the
technical
definition
.

Because
Usamah
is
Saudi
,
my
guess
is
that
they
were
especially
influenced
by
an
extremist
form
of
the
Wahhabi
school
of
Islam
that
predominates
among
Saudia
's
some
15
million
citizens
.

In
1998
they
were
joined
by
Egyptians
from
the
al
-
Jihad
al
-
Islami
group
of
Ayman
al
-
Zawahiri
(
many
of
these
were
from
Upper
Egypt
,
especially
Asyut
and
environs
)
.

After
that
point
,
al
-
Qaeda
was
a
joint
enterprise
between
the
Egyptian
extremists
and
the
polyglot
Arabs
around
Bin
Laden
,
only
some
of
whom
were
Saudi
.

Zarqawi
is
a
Jordanian
,
and
his
Monotheism
and
Holy
War
group
in
Afghanistan
probably
had
a
distinctive
coloration
as
mainly
Jordanian
,
Palestinian
and
Syrian
.

They
also
had
a
special
connection
to
some
extremists
in
Jordan
and
Germany
.

They
are
probably
especially
oriented
toward
the
Salafi
school
of
modern
Islamic
thought
,
which
has
a
Protestant
-
like
emphasis
on
going
back
to
the
original
practice
of
the
early
companions
of
the
Prophet
Muhammad
.

(
Most
Salafis
are
not
militant
or
violent
,
though
they
tend
to
be
rather
narrow
-
minded
in
my
experience
,
on
the
order
of
Protestant
Pietists
)
.

Monotheism
and
Holy
War
obviously
does
have
a
violent
interpretation
of
Salafism
,
rather
as
the
the
leaders
of
the
so
-
called
German
Peasant
Rebellion
among
early
Protestants
did
.

Another
worrisome
sign
is
that
local
Iraqi
Sunni
fundamentalists
opposed
to
the
US
presence
in
Iraq
have
begun
joining
Monotheism
and
Holy
War
,
and
wearing
its
distinctive
orange
and
black
insignia
.

These
have
been
sighted
among
Iraqi
crowds
on
Haifa
Street
in
Baghdad
and
in
Samarra
.

So
now
there
are
hundreds
of
al
-
Qaeda
members
in
Iraq
where
there
had
been
none
before
.

The
consolidation
of
smaller
local
radical
fundamentalist
groups
with
al
-
Qaeda
can
also
be
seen
in
the
case
of
the
Fizazi
group
in
Tangiers
that
morphed
into
the
Moroccan
Islamic
Combatant
Group
,
had
members
who
met
with
September
11
ringleader
Muhammad
Atta
,
and
ultimately
was
in
part
responsible
for
the
Madrid
train
bombings
.

The
September
11
Panel
will
issue
its
findings
on
Thursday
.

It
notes
10
points
at
which
the
US
made
key
mistakes
that
might
have
stopped
Bin
Laden
's
plot
.

Four
of
these
were
under
Clinton
and
6
under
Bush
.

Bush
came
out
today
and
said
that
if
he
had
known
what
was
coming
,
he
would
have
expended
every
effort
to
stop
it
,
and
that
so
would
have
Clinton
.

This
statement
is
,
despite
its
facade
of
fair
-
mindedness
,
so
many
weasel
words
.

Of
course
Bush
would
have
tried
to
stop
9/11
if
he
had
known
it
was
coming
.

The
question
is
,
"
Should
he
have
known
it
was
coming
?
"

The
answer
is
,
"
Yes
!
"

We
now
know
that
Bush
and
his
administration
came
into
office
obsessed
with
Iraq
.

Cheney
was
looking
at
maps
of
Iraq
oil
fields
and
muttering
about
opportunities
for
US
companies
there
,
already
in
January
or
February
of
2001
.

Wolfowitz
contradicted
counter-terrorism
czar
Richard
Clarke
when
the
latter
spoke
of
the
al
-
Qaeda
threat
,
insisting
that
the
preeminent
threat
of
terrorism
against
the
US
came
from
Iraq
,
and
indicating
he
accepted
Laurie
Mylroie
's
crackpot
conspiracy
theory
that
Saddam
was
behind
the
1993
World
Trade
Towers
bombing
.

If
you
believe
crackpot
theories
instead
of
focusing
on
the
reality
--
that
was
an
al
-
Qaeda
operation
mainly
carried
out
by
al
-
Gamaa
al
-
Islamiyyah
,
an
Egyptian
terrorist
component
allied
with
Bin
Laden
--
then
you
will
concentrate
on
the
wrong
threat
.

Even
after
the
attacks
on
September
11
,
Bush
was
obsessing
about
Iraq
.

Wolfowitz
lied
to
him
and
said
that
there
was
a
10
to
50
%
chance
that
Iraq
was
behind
them
.

(
On
what
evidence
?

The
hijackers
were
obviously
al
-
Qaeda
,
and
no
operational
links
between
al
-
Qaeda
and
Iraq
had
ever
been
found
)
.

Rumsfeld
initially
rejected
an
attack
on
al
-
Qaeda
bases
in
Afghanistan
,
saying
there
were
"
no
good
targets
"
in
Afghanistan
.

(
What
about
40
al
-
Qaeda
bases
that
had
trained
the
9/11
hijackers
and
other
terrorists
gunning
for
the
United
States
??
)

The
Pentagon
did
not
even
have
a
plan
for
dealing
with
Afghanistan
or
al
-
Qaeda
that
it
could
pull
off
the
shelf
,
according
to
Bob
Woodward
.

Bush
did
not
have
his
eye
on
the
ball
.

Neither
did
Cheney
,
Rumsfeld
,
or
Wolfowitz
.

They
were
playing
Captain
Ahab
to
Saddam
's
great
white
whale
.

Imperial
Hubris
makes
the
case
that
lots
of
people
in
the
CIA
and
counter-terrorism
divisions
elsewhere
in
the
US
government
knew
all
about
Bin
Laden
and
the
threat
he
posed
.

They
were
from
all
accounts
marginalized
and
not
listened
to
.

Bush
demoted
Dick
Clarke
,
among
the
most
vocal
and
focused
of
the
al
-
Qaeda
experts
,
from
his
cabinet
.

Dick
could
never
thereafter
get
any
real
cooperation
from
the
cabinet
officers
,
who
outranked
him
,
and
he
could
not
convince
them
to
go
to
battle
stations
in
the
summer
of
2001
when
George
Tenet
's
hair
was
"
on
fire
"
about
the
excited
chatter
the
CIA
was
picking
up
from
radical
Islamist
terrorists
.

As
for
the
Clinton
administration
,
let
me
say
one
thing
in
its
defense
.

Clinton
had
worked
out
a
deal
with
Pakistani
Prime
Minister
Nawaz
Sharif
in
summer
of
1999
that
would
have
allowed
the
US
to
send
a
Special
Ops
team
in
after
Bin
Laden
in
Qandahar
,
based
from
Pakistan
.

I
presume
you
need
the
Pakistan
base
for
rescue
operations
in
case
anything
went
wrong
.

You
also
need
Pakistani
air
space
.

The
plan
was
all
set
and
could
have
succeeded
.

But
in
fall
of
1999
,
Gen.
Pervez
Musharraf
made
a
coup
against
Nawaz
Sharif
.

The
Pakistani
army
was
rife
with
elements
protective
of
the
Taliban
,
and
the
new
military
government
reneged
on
the
deal
.

Musharraf
told
Clinton
he
could
n't
use
Pakistani
soil
or
air
space
to
send
the
team
in
against
Bin
Laden
.

Look
at
a
map
and
you
try
to
figure
out
how
,
in
fall
of
1999
,
you
could
possibly
pull
off
such
an
operation
without
Pakistani
facilities
.

Of
course
,
you
could
just
go
in
by
main
force
.

But
for
those
of
you
tempted
in
that
direction
,
please
look
up
Carter
's
Tabas
operation
.

It
should
be
easily
googled
.

Clinton
tried
,
and
tried
hard
.

The
gods
were
n't
with
us
on
that
one
.

that
is
how
i
want
you
to
refer
to
me
as
"
the
king
"

i
do
n't
think
so

John
,

Hello
from
South
America
.

I
just
got
your
email
and
I
certainly
concur
with
Jeff
making
the
call
.

He
has
maintained
a
good
relationship
with
Mulva
.

This
was
a
risk
that
we
had
but
we
did
have
assurances
from
Phillips
regarding
performance
.

I
do
n't
know
how
much
it
will
help
however
.

Richard
Harper
and
Mary
Nell
Browning
may
have
some
ideas
here
but
I
am
sure
you
've
already
gone
through
it
with
them
.

I
am
amazed
how
the
details
get
fuzzy
on
an
old
project
.

When
you
discussed
it
,
i
was
trying
to
think
back
to
our
remedies
and
discussions
but
the
3
years
have
made
it
difficult
.

I
do
n't
know
if
there
is
anything
I
can
do
but
I
'm
always
willing
to
help
.

Good
luck
,

Mike

Not
going
well

Hello
Louise
,

I
know
you
must
be
going
nuts
with
all
the
events
,
so
I

Stephanie

not
sure
,
but
i
assume
that
the
bluegrass
songbook
is
mine
.

is
it
for
guitar
?

I
'll
need
to
ponder
.

I
'll
try

get
back
to
you
pronto

We
have
this
report

Hi
David
:

Thought
that
you
might
be
interested

Best
,

Jeff

Well
,
he
launched
today
.

Have
you
seen
the
materials
from
the
press
conference
that
he
launched
today
?

I
think
this
is
actually
a
good
thing
--
makes
our
proposal
look
like
a
much
more
preferable
alternative
by
comparison
,
makes
our
support
in
the
process
more
important
,
and
sets
Harvey
up
as
the
Ralph
Nader
equivalent
in
the
election
to
fix
California
's
broken
system
---
a
potential
spoiler
.

Hi
.

Well
,
would
n't
you
know
it
.

I
'm
not
driving
tonite
,
but
I
bet
that
we
could
hitch
a
ride
back
with
Anil
.

I
'm
not
sure
,
but
I
think
that
he
's
got
class
tonite
,
too
.

I
'll
search
him
out
before
class
or
after
that
break
and
see
if
I
can
set
it
up
.

daily
dose
on
enron
-

we
are
finished
.

i
need
to
now
get
a
job
at
house
of
pies
b/c
that
is
the
only
way
to
pay
the
bills
.

the
economy
is
down
and
when
enron
collapses
,
the
energy
industry
is
going
to
be
in
a
world
of
hurt
.

not
to
mention
the
market
is
going
to
be
flooded
with
enron
folks
.

ca
n't
go
to
any
more
lsu
games
unless
i
get
a
free
ticket
.

Since
work
has
gone
to
hell
,
I
am
hoping
to
find
some
excitement
in
the
possibility
that
LSU
may
play
in
the
Cotton
Bowl
(
if
Rohan
"
Alabama
"
Davey
shows
up
for
the
next
3
games
.
)

However
,
do
not
purchase
tickets
until
it
is
a
done
deal
-

lesson
I
learned
following
the
Ark

last

Vince
,

We
are
still
trying
to
work
the
PSE
swap
transaction
,
now
that
the
forex
desk
has
been
able
to
find
a
fix
for
CPI
in
the
market
.

Further
to
my
voicemail
,
our
colleagues
in
credit
are
calculating
the
reserve
on
the
PSE
swap
.

They
are
currently
using
9.5
%
fixed
based
on
the
1
year
implied
volatility
.

Volatility
of
USD
/
DM
has
been
in
the
range
of
between
7
%
and
11
%
.

Can
one
of
your
research
staff
justify
a
suitable
20
year
volalatility
number
for
USD
/
Euro
.

Ideally
,
we
would
like
a
fast
turnaround
.

In
addition
,
is
there
someone
who
could
consider
the
correlation
between
US
CPI
and
the
$
/
euro
exchange
rate
.

The
credit
guys
are
currently
assuming
that
there
is
no
correlation
and
may
consequently
be
double
dipping
the
credit
reserve
on
this
basis
too
.

Grateful
for
any
help
or
suggestions
you
could
provide
.

Sid

Vincent
,

I
met
you
at
the
Risk
conference
last
week
in
Houston
.

I
enjoyed
your
presentations
very
much
.

I
was
wondering
if
you
could
give
me
some
references
regarding
the
calculation
of
correlation
coefficients
from
a
GARCH
model
.

Thank
you

I
have
settled
the
Ecogas
/
Enron
/
Randy
Maffett
lawsuit
.

No
need
to
thank
me
,
just
send
me
gifts
.

Seriously
,
I
talked
this
morning
with
Tom
Hall
and
we
agreed
that
Ecogas
would
pay
him
$
53,000
.

Hall
has
agreed
to
release
Enron
,
Ecogas
,
Maffett
and
every
affiliate
,
related
party
and
subsidiary
.

He
will
also
release
any
and
all
patent
issues
.

The
goal
is
for
him
to
move
on
with
his
life
and
for
us
to
move
on
as
well
.

I
have
asked
Doug
Daniels
to
prepare
the
settlement
papers
reflecting
such
an
agreement
.

Please
handle

Daren
,

I
was
wondering
if
it
would
be
OK
for
me
to
sit
in
with
you
one
day
to
get
a
general
feel
of
your
end
of
the
process
.

Pat
had
told
me
before
he
left
that
it
would
help
me
better
grasp
the
process
as
a
whole
.

I
understand
the
imminent
cold
weather
is
making
things
crazy
,
so
now
may
not
be
the
best
time
to
be
in
your
way
.

But
let
me
know
if
I
can
spend
a
day
,
morning
,
or
even
just
an
afternoon
down
there
with
you
whenever
it
is
a
good
time
.

I
think
it
will
help
me
very
much
in
my
role
.

Thanks

'68
the
Dow
had
fallen
to
825
,
only
to
climb
to
a
highly
speculative
peak
of
985
in
December
of
'68
.

The
Dow
then
sank
to
631
in
December
of
'70
.

By
April
of
'71
the
Dow
had
climbed
back
to
950
,
only
to
fall
to
869
in
February
of
'72
.

A
big
rally
then
took
the
Dow
(
unconfirmed
)
to
a
record
high
of
1051
in
January
of
'73
,
turning
everyone
bullish
.

But
by
December
of
'73
the
Dow
had
collapsed
to
788
.

Think
that
was
bad
-
by
December
of
'74
the
Dow
had
sunk
to
a
bear
market
low
of
577
.

At
that
time
,
the
gurus
and
geniuses
of
Wall
Street
were
predicting
a
250
Dow
and
many
were
talking
openly
about
the
end
of
capitalism
.

Of
course
,
that
was
the
bottom

And
that
's
the
way
the
greatest
bear
market
since
the
Depression
worked
its
way
down
.

By
late
1974
investors
were
dizzy
,
they
were
desperate
,
they
were
wrung
-
out
,
they
had
left
Wall
Street
,
many
for
good
.

great
,
we
look
forward
to
seeing
you
.

The
results
of
the
February
26th
PVT
test
conducted
on
Nville
have
been
discussed
with
each
of
you
over
the
last
three
months
.

As
we
have
discussed
....
effective
Sep
13th
,
Anita
will
make
the
adjustments
to
Enron
's
inventory
and
pad
gas
to
reflect
the
February
26th
results
.

I
talked
with
Gary
Wilson
,
and
he
confirmed
that
the
revised
values
are
correct
.

Attached
is
a
spreadsheet
that
contains
the
values
.

The
correction
to
the
working
gas
includes
TWO
corrections
.

The
results
of
the
February
26th
test
reduces
the
working
gas
by
398,487
MMBTU
.

In
addition
,
there
is
a
reduction
of
22,101
MMBTU
which
is
the
difference
between
the
SCADA
values
(
Best
Available
)
that
Anita
showed
on
the
February
29th
Storage
Sheet
and
the
"
official
"
February
29th
values
that
Gary
Wilson
received
from
MIPS
.

To
summarize
:
Enron
's
pad
gas
will
now
be
3,993,310
MMBTU
,
instead
of
4,223,000
MMBTU
.

Enron
's
working
gas
will
be
reduced
by
420,588
MMBTU
.

Call
me
if
there
are
any
questions
.

fyi

yeah
i
got
yelled
at
also
.

i
tried
to
say
i
was
n't
that
drunk
but
z
was
n't
having
any
of
that
conversation
.

she
told
me
that
after
friday
and
saturday
she
felt
i
was
slowly
regressing
.

then
i
told
her
i
felt
i
should
be
able
to
screw
missy
just
once
.

she
said
that
was
ok
.

Did
you
get
in
as
much
trouble
as
I
did
this
weekend
-
Lori
seems
to
think
I
need
to
get
help
-
I
told
her
it
's
normal
to
drink
all
day
at
a
bar
,
then
go
to
dinner
where
you
do
n't
know
half
the
people
there
and
proceed
to
get
extremely
fucked
up

I
've
thought
about
you
a
few
times
in
the
last
few
months
,
did
n't
want
to
intrude
upon
an
already
bad
situation
with
my
bullshit
questions
.

I
'm
hearing
some
pretty
depressing
stuff
from
the
people
I
know
at
ENE
.

I
wish
I
had
the
capital
to
open
my
own
shop
?

there
will
be
talent
and
opportunity
a
plenty
on
the
market
soon
.

I
'll
ask
around
?

I
've
got
some
friends
at
Duke
and
Dynegy
from
B
-
school
,
the
Gianoucous
(
spelling
??
)
brothers
(
John
and
Dimitri
?
from
elementary
school
)
started
their
own
outfit
a
while
back
,
and
my
old
man
is
at
Schlumberger
and
has
good
contacts
in
general
(
if
you
are
n't
married
to
a
trading
environment
)
.

Give
me
a
few
days
,
and
I
'll
be
in
touch
.

Michael

here

I
drafted

Into

-
not

this
anything
close

what
you
all
had
in
mind

Please
let

know
what
shape
you
all
think
the
offer
ought
to
take
and
we
can
revise
accordingly
.

Attached
are
clean
and
blacklined
drafts
of
the
Enron
guaranties
to
be
made
in
support
of
EPMI
's
obligations
under
the
Indian
Mesa
II
Renewable
Energy
Purchase
Agreement
(
"
PPA
"
)
and
Green
Premium
Sharing
Agreement
(
"
GSPA
"
)
.?

The
guaranty
for
the
PPA
is
blacklined
against
the
Enron
EPC
Contract
guaranty
in
favor
of
the
banks
which
was
granted
in
connection
with
our
Cabazon
Wind
Power
Project
(
the
project
most
recently
financed
by
EWC
)
and
the
GPSA
guaranty
is
blacklined
against
the
PPA
guaranty
.

As
we
discussed
last
week
,
since
the
Enron
guaranties
will
need
to
be
in
a
form
that
will
acceptable
to
our
project
lenders
and
equity
participants
,
we
thought
that
we
should
start
with
a
form
that
was
used
in
our
last
financing
and
that
was
negotiated
by
Enron
and
the
banks
.

We
plan
to
use
the
same
basic
form
for
the
Enron
guaranty
that
will
be
made
in
favor
of
EPMI
with
respect
to
the
seller
's
obligations
under
the
PPA
.

We
will
forward
the
draft
of
that
guaranty
to
you
later
today
.

Please
feel
free
to
give
me
a
call
if
you
have
any
questions
concerning
the
attached
guaranties
.

Thank
you
.

a
presentation
I
gave
at
the
Canadian
Risk
Managers

in

in
the
fall
of

I
'll
try
and
send
one
of

as
well
but
may
have
some
problems
due
to
file
size
.

In
any

should
give
you
a
starting
point
.

Vince
:

Your
suggestion
to
introduce
the
concept
discussed
with
one
of
the
Lays
is
welcomed
.

I
hope
that
this
would
mean
that
you
would
remain
involved
at
some
level
.

The
design
of
the
model
and
its
potential
economics
could
be
key
to
how
worthy
the
effort
might
be
.

Enron
could
be
an
ideal
environment
from
which
to
the
concept
enhancement
through
to
commercialization
could
be
successfully
accomplished
.

Please
confidentially
share
matters
as
you
think
best
and
advise
me
of
the
interest
generated
.

I
am
ready
to
meet
there
at
your
building
or
elsewhere
that
is
appropriate
.

regards

fine

Hey

I
am
being
told
by
my
better
half
that
we
need
to
get
an
accurate
head
count
of
who
will
be
attending
our
wedding
.

If
you
would
be
so
kind
,
could
you
possibly
let
me
know
of
your
status
over
the
next
couple
of
days
?

For
those
of
you
who
already
sent
us
an
RSVP
response
recently
,
please
disregard
.

Thanks
for
your
help
!

Jeff

those
additional

Sanjeev

if

I
would

Key
Delhi
blast
suspect
arrested

Police
in
the
Indian
capital
Delhi
say
they
have
arrested
the
suspected
co-ordinator
and
financier
of
last
month
's
deadly
bomb
blasts
in
the
city
.

Delhi
police
chief
K
K
Paul
named
the
man
as
Tariq
Ahmed
Dar
,
and
said
police
were
hunting
for
four
accomplices
.

He
said
Mr
Dar
,
33
,
was
arrested
in
Indian
-
administered
Kashmir
and
belonged
to
the
outlawed
Lashkar
-
e
-
Toiba
militant
group
.

The

I
like
the
way
Otto
Jespersen
(
in
'
Language
:
Its
Nature
,
Development
and
Origin
'
)
aptly
summarised
the
nature
of
language
changes
by
comparing
it
with
one
of
the
theories
of
the
Manchester
School
of
Economics
:

'
Everything
is
for
the
best
in
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
if
only
no
artificial
hindrances
are
put
in
the
way
of
free
exchange
,
for
demand
and
supply
will
regulate
everything
better
than
any
Government
would
be
able
to
.
'

Portia

This
is
a
beautiful
site
and
a
wonderful
idea
.

And
a
portion
of
each
package
or
memorial
purchased
goes
to
a
charity
on
their
database
.

So
be
sure
to
get
your
pet
's
memorial
on
the
site
and
if
you
have
a
charity
/
rescue
,
make
sure
it
is
listed
on
their
database
so
you
can
receive
some
of
the
profits
from
the
site
.

Best
,

"
Inhibitory

are

for

the
pattern

The

of
Hurricane
Katrina
are
powerful
evidence
that
political
and
economic
decisions
made
in
the
United
States

other
countries
have
failed
to
account
for
our
dependence
on
a
healthy
resource
base
,
according
to
an
assessment
released
today
by
the
Worldwatch
Institute
.

Alteration
of
the
Mississippi
River
and
the
destruction
of
wetlands
at
its
mouth
have
left
the
area
around
New
Orleans
abnormally
vulnerable
to
the
forces
of

.

According

the

With
protests
going
on
in
the
Chilean
capital
of
Santiago
(
from
the
economic
summit
)
,
President
Bush
visited
Chinese
President
Hu
Jintao
and
other
key
allies
in
Santiago
.

The
talk
of
the
day
besides
a
more
level
playing
field
with
China
was
North
Korea
.

China
has
been
a
great
help
at
getting
North
Korea
to
the
table
and
Bush
is
hoping
that
with
their
cooperation
Korea
can
become
a
nuclear
free
peninsula
.

is

Santiago
for
the
annual
Asia

Hopefully
President
Bush
can
accomplish
these
goals
which
will
not
only
help
strengthen
our
Chinese
allies
,
but
will
also
help

in
Hong
Kong
.

He
is
now
lecturing
in
USA
.

His
art
perfectly
combines
painting
and
Chinese
calligraphy
.

He
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
leading
Avant
-
Garde
artist
of
modern
calligraphy
.

His
artworks
were
selected
and
exhibited
in
British
Museum
in
2002
.

"
Wei
has
given
some
virtuoso
performances
with
brush
and
ink
,
often
incorporating
several
different
techniques
into
a
single
work
,
"
said
Gordon
S.
Barrass
,
curator
of
the
exhibition
.

In
the
world
of
"
Wei
's
magic
cubes
,
"
all
seem
to
be
ingeniously
planned
and
tricky
.

All
are
mathematical
,
all
are
linguistic
.

In
Wei
's
art
,
a
logician
could
see
mathematical
logic
,
a
cellist
could
see
a
ripple
of
nine
bass
notes
,
a
country
girl
could
see
straw
,
and
Harry
Potter
could
see
two
accompanied
green
blazes
.

"
...
to
gaze
at
Wei
's
art
is
like
entering
a
floating
world
of
dreams

Wiki
Media
Foundation
,
the
group
behind
the
Wikipedia
online
encyclopedia
project
,
said
Friday
that
search
giant
Google
has
volunteered
to
host
some
of
its
content
on
company
servers
.

(
ZD
Net
)

It
looks
like
the
war
between
Microsoft
and
Google
is
quickly
brewing
on
the
horizon
.

Microsoft
is
4
-
0
(
they
took
down
Netscape
,
Suns
Systems
,
MAC
and
IBM
)
and
Google
may
be
their
next
target
.

Google
is
probably
making
this
move
to
counter
Microsoft
Search
using
Encarta
(
it's
online
dictionary
)
.

More
below
.

But
it
looks
like
Google
is
n't
opening
it's
mouth
about
the
reason
behind
the
offer
as
Linux
News
reports
:

"
While
we
do
n't
have
anything
specific
to
announce
today
,
Google
and
the
Wikimedia
Foundation
are
collaboratively
evaluating
creative
ways
to
support
Wikipedia.org
and
its
community
.
"

Sure
Google
,
although
this
would
put
it
on
coarse
for
global
domination
of
the
internet
by
2014
.

It
will
be
interesting
to
see
whether
or
not
Google
will
finally
slay
the
Microsoft
Goliath
,
who
has
known
no
major
defeat
and
seeks
to
vanquish
all
competition
.

Hello
there

Action
Network
is
a
BBC
website
for
people
who
are
taking
action
on
issues
that
concern
them
.

I
'm
getting
in
touch
because
I
think
it
could
be
useful
to
people
campaigning
about
hospital
closures
.

We
've
got
a
page
dedicated
to
issues
around
hospitals
(
http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/C55153
)
and
a
group
called
NHS
SOS
have
already
put
up
a
campaign
about
ward
closures
in
Cumbria
.

I
'm
hoping
to
build
this
up
to
be
a
hub
for
all
the
campaigners
-
a
place
where
people
can
exchange
ideas
and
advice
.

It
would
be
great
if
the
person
from
CHANT
who
started
this
page
would
put
up
a
short
description
of
the
campaign
and
a
list
to
this
group
page
on
the
Action
Network
site
.

Action
Network
is
also
a
good
place
to
post
details
of
events
,
or
try
to
rally
together
a
group
if
you
want
to
take
action
in
your
area
.

You
can
attach
anything
you
write
to
pages
for
your
local
area
,
as
well
as
to
the
'
issue
'
pages
.

I
'm
more
than
happy
to
help
people
with
the
site
or
answer
any
questions
about
Action
Network
-
just
drop
me
a
message
.

Otherwise
,
hope
to
see
you
there
!

Kind
regards

Winston
Peters
is
visiting
a
school
.

In
one
class
,
he
asks
the
students
if
anyone
can
give
him
an
example
of
a
"
tragedy
"
.

One
little
boy
stands
up
and
offers
that
,
"
if
my
best
friend
who
lives
next
door
was
playing
in
the
street
when
a
car
came
along
and
killed
him
,
that
would
be
a
tragedy
"
.

"
No
,
"
Winston
says
,
"
That
would
be
an
ACCIDENT
.
"

A
girl
raises
her
hand
.

"
If
a
school
bus
carrying
fifty
children
drove
off
a
cliff
,
killing
everyone
involved
...
that
would
be
a
tragedy
"
.

"
I
'm
afraid
not
,
"
explains
Winston
,
"
that
is
what
we
would
call
a
GREAT
LOSS
.
"

The
room
is
silent
,
none
of
the
other
children
volunteer
.

"
What
?
"
asks
Winston
,
"
is
n't
there
any
one
here
who
can
give
me
an
example
of
a
tragedy
?
"

Finally
,
a
boy
in
the
back
raises
his
hand
.

In
a
timid
voice
,
he
says
:
"
If
an
airplane
carrying
Winston
Peters
was
blown
up
by
a
bomb
,
THAT
would
be
a
tragedy
"
.

"
Wonderful
!
"
Winston
beams
.

"
Marvelous
!

And
can
you
tell
me
WHY
that
would
be
a
tragedy
?
"

"
Well
,
"
says
the
boy
,
"
because
it
would
n't
be
an
accident
,
and
it
certainly
would
n't
be
a
great
loss
!

It
looks
like
The
Lunar
Transportation
Systems
,
Inc.
is
visualizing
a
"
space
highway
"
going
from
the
moon
to
Earth
(
and
back
again
)
.

"
Our
new
lunar
transportation
system
utilizes
a
unique
architecture
that
will
establish
the
equivalent
of
a
two
-
way
highway
between
the
Earth
and
the
Moon
,
"
Kistler
told
SPACE.com
.

"
Our
plans
include
raising
private
capital
to
develop
,
build
,
flight
test
,
and
operate
this
Earth
-
Moon
highway
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
and
the
benefit
of
our
investors
.
"

Wise
decision
to
go
through
the
private
sector
--
NASA
's
budget
may
be
kinda
tight
to
fund
a
project
like
this
.

This
group
does
sound
pretty
interesting
though
.

The
Lunar
Transporatation
Systems
(
LTS
)
is
actually
being
funded
by
two
space
businessmen
,
Walter
Kistler
and
Bob
Citron
.

Both
of
these
men
are
heavily
involved
in
the
private
sector
of
the
space
industry
,
and
both
are
also
involved
with
another
space
company
called
SPACEHAB
.

They
want
to
use
LTS
to
tie
into
NASA
's
vision
for
Space
Exploration
,
and
seem
pleased
that
the
White
House
is
moving
in
that
direction
.

"
We
are
so
excited
that
the
White
House
and
the
recent
new
government
space
policy
underscores
the
need
to
involve
the
private
sector
in
assisting
NASA
develop
its
plans
for
the
new
Vision
for
Space
Exploration
,
"
said
Walter
Kistler
,
LTS
co-founder
and
Chairman
.

With
their
proposal
of
a
"
Earth
-
Moon
"
highway
,
it
looks
like
space
tourism
may
become
a
reality
sooner
than
we
think
.

]

(
Space.com
)

U.S.
astronauts
will
launch
to
the
moon
on
sleek
,
single
,
shuttle
booster
rockets
and
the
first
new
upper
-
stage
rocket
this
country
has
developed
in
more
than
a
decade
,
NASA
and
the
Pentagon
have
told
the
White
House
.

Lunar
landers
and
other
gear
needed
for
extended
visits
to
the
moon
will
be
lofted
by
gargantuan
launchers
as
big
as
the
Apollo
-
era
Saturn
5
,
the
most
powerful
rockets
ever
flown
.

It
looks
as
if
NASA
is
transitioning
away
from
the
shuttle
model
,
as
in
the
past
they
have
proven
to
be
quite
dangerous
as
Columbia
has
recently
proved
.

Although
these
new
rockets
are
probably
more
expensive
,
they
will
be
able
to
go
at
a
much
greater
range
than
it's
shuttle
cousins
,
as
they
can
not
only
break
free
from
the
atmosphere
but
reach
the
moon
as
well
.

"
NASA
will
initiate
development
of
a
Crew
Launch
Vehicle
derived
from
space
shuttle
solid
rocket
boosters
with
a
new
upper
stage
for
human
spaceflight
,
"
said
the
letter
,
signed
by
NASA
Administrator
Mike
Griffin
and
the
Pentagon
's
top
space
official
,
ex-astronaut
Ron
Sega
...

"
NASA
then
plans
to
develop
a
new
100
-
metric
-
ton
-
class
launch
vehicle
derived
from
existing
capabilities
with
the
space
shuttle
external
tanks
and
solid
rocket
boosters
for
future
missions
to
the
moon
,
"
the
letter
said
.

NASA
is
planning
on
using
these
new
shuttles
to
replace
the
current
models
,
with
industry
forecasters
predicting
a
launch
as
early
as
2014
.

The
new
rocket
design
will
differ
slightly
from
it's
predecessors
,
in
the
fact
that
the
crew
and
cargo
would
launch
separately
from
two
different
rockets
each
and
join
up
in
space
later
on
.

Launching
this
way
will
hopefully
avoid
future
disasters
,
giving
more
support
towards
NASA
revisiting
the
stars
.

depends
on

if

the

so

ideas
for

usint
the
word
MAD
on
a
white
paper
in

artsy
way

The
actual
word
"
MAD
"
has
to
be
on
the
cover
and
incorporated
into
the
image
.

MAD
means
crazy
,
or
angry
,
so
you
do
a
lot
with
it
,
i
would
put
a
gorrilla
screaming
,
just
the
face
,
and
just
throw
in
a

of
brushes
fifferent
colors

make

When
the

returned
to
Indochina
at
the
end
of
WW
II
the
Viet
Minh
were
in
control
of
the
Red
River
Delta
.

They
chased
the
Communists
out
of
the
capital
(
Hanoi
)
and
retook
control
.

Is
that
what
you
are
referring
to
?

You
need
to
check
out
the
French

(
1946

how
many
ounces
in
a
pint
in
ireland
?

Depends
of
what
.

Ounces
measure
weight
,
pints
measure
volume
.

If
you
mean
fluid
ounces
,
20
,
as
opposed
to
the
16
in
America
.

An
Irish
pint
is
larger
than
a
US
one
.

20

in

as

do
not
sound
that
Irish
,
I
was
surprised
to
hear
they
were
from
Dublin
.

Well
if
you
are
interested
,
I
suggest
you
have
a
look
at
General
Fiasco
,
Two
Door
Cinema
Club
and
Wallis
Bird
.

I
think
you
will
be
pleased
.

I
doubt
you
will
get
a
sensible
answer
in
the
"
TRAVEL
"
section
.

Ireland

And
there
's
nothing
distinctly
Irish
about
them
.

You
'd
find
similar
bands
to
them
that
are
from
the
UK
and
US
.

Women
's
rain
coat
...
where
can
I
find
one
?

I
'm
going
on
a
trip
to
Europe
soon
,
and
I
need
to
find
a
good
,
quality
raincoat
.

I
've
looked
and
looked
,
but
can
not
find
one
anywhere
!

I
would
prefer
a
simple
,
fitted
black
one
.

It
actually
needs
to
be
relatively
waterproof
-
the
last
one
I
bought
had
me
soaked
in
anything
more
than
light
/
moderate
rain
.

I
'll
pay
up
to
200
-
250
for
it
if
I
have
to
.

Look
on
the
debenhams
website

in
the
craghoppers
section

they
do
some
good
waterproof
raincoats

You
do
n't
...
there
's
no
such
thing
as
"
pause
"
in
digital
recording
.

That
's
because
of
the
buffer
that
holds
the
data
until
it
's
ready
to
be
recorded
to
the
memory
card
.

When
you
press
the
button
to
stop
recording
the
data
is
moved
from
the
buffer
to
the
memory
card
-
no
pause

All
you
can
do
is
take
each

(

and

I
have
a
Nacho
Libre
question
.?

When
nacho
is
driving
to
cure
the
influenza
guy
does
he
say
to
the
man
with
the
cow
i
like
your
blouse
or
I
like
your
cow
because
my
friend
thinks
he
says
I
like
your
blouse
,
but
that
would
n't
make
sense
.

I
know
it
s
in
the
wrong
catagory
,
but
still
,
I
wrote
this
question
for
a
reason
,
not
for
you
to
critisize
me
.

Okay
,
FIRST
,
you
have
posted
a
question
about
an
American
movie
,
set
in
Mexico
,
in
the
Dining
Out
in
Argentina
category
.

Do
you
get
what
's
wrong
with
this
picture
?

No
...
that
's
all
.

No
second
.

Nacho
Libre
is
suppose
to
be
inspired
in
Mexicans
,
not
in
Argentineans
.

Hackney
's
has
a
great
burger
formula
that
started
about
80
years
ago
.

There
are
currently
5
locations
:

http://www.hackneys.net/

The
latest
spot
for
a
real
Hackney
's
is
Printers
'
Row
:

showed
at

Along
with
the
great
burger
try
a
brick
of
onion
rings
if
you
are
with
someone
.

Otherwise
a
1/2
brick
will
be
fine

My
dog
has
threw
up
yellow
bile
for
two
days
but
does
not
have
dhirea
.

What
should
I
do
?

I
've
tried
bland
white
rice
but
he
wo
nt
eat
anything
.

What
could
it
be
?

Should
I
be
concerned
?

Call
a
vet
would
be
a
good
idea
with
a
sick
dog

VERY
CONCERNED
!!!

plz
bring
your
dog
to
the
vet
ASAP
!!!

esp
if
not
eating
-
if
it
had
only
happened
once
and
could
get
him
to
eat
right
away
-
it
could
have
been
you
missed
his
meal
time
and
he
needed
to
eat
-
since
it
sounds
like
it
has
happened
several
times
over
two
days
-
then
he
may
have
gotten
int
to
something
that
needs
to
be
attended
to
RIGHT
AWAY
!!!

or
has
acquired
some
type
of
disease
and
that
too
needs
to
be
attended
to

why
are
there
two
statues
of
David
?

i
doing
a
research
paper
on
donatello
and
i
notice
that
there
are
two
statues
of
David
,
a
bronze
one
and
marble
one
.

Michelangelo
made
the
marble
one
but
why
did
he
do
another
if
Donatello
had
already
made
one
?

so
i
m
a
little
confused
,
why
is
there
two
statues
of
David
?

different
generations
,
the
donatello
is
of
a
boy
david
as
a
young
sheep
Herder
,
the
Michelangelo
is
the
grown
up
man
david
as
slayer
and
king

Because
he
liked
making
statues
of
David
!
:D

Obviously
,
he
should
have
been
arrested
and
jailed
-
imagine
making
a
statue
or
painting
on
the
same
subject
as
another
artist
-
clearly
insulting
and
disrespecting
-
wasted
time
that
could
have
been
used
making
a
statue
with
clothes
on
.

Name
of
specific
Hibachi
restaurant
in
Chicago
?

I
have
a
friend
out
in
Chicago
this
week
,
and
I
am
trying
to
remember
the
name
of
an
awesome
hibachi
style
restaurant
i
visited
while
out
there
a
couple
years
ago
.

I
think
it
was
in
the
Lincoln
Square
area
but
do
n't
quote
me
on
that
.

It's
'
gimmick
'
was
that
you
fill
your
bowl
cafeteria
-
style
from
raw
ingredients
and
leave
it
on
the
counter
with
a
chopstick
listing
your
table
number
on
it
.

Four
guys
around
a
large
square
open
hibachi
cook
your
food
,
and
when
it
's
finished
a
server
brings
it
to
your
table
.

All
-
you
can
-
eat
style
deal
.

It
was
pretty
epic
as
I
remember
and
would
love
to
send
my
friend
there
.

Any
help
?

What
's
the
best
time
to
start
a
trip
around
the
world
?

Well
,
I
'm
about
to
graduate
in
less
then
a
year
,
and
I
'm
planning
to
study
medical
school
.

But
since
in
my
country
it
lasts
for
minimum
6
years
,
and
I
want
to
go
aground
the
world
,
what
do
you
think
,
should
I
do
it
before
or
after
medical
school
?

If
you
can
afford
to
go
before
,
then
by
all
means
,
GO
.

If
you
have
to
wait
,
due
to
financial
reasons
,
then
wait
.

I
would
much
rather
put
it
off
until
I
can
afford
to
have
the
vacation
of
a
lifetime
as
I
'm
sure
this
trip
is
intended
to
be
.

Airfare
alone
will
be
incredibly
expensive
so
make
sure
you
have
the
money
and
of
course
free
time
to
take
your
time
and
have
a
great
time
.

canon
t2i
stops
working
?

My
canon
t2i
stops
working
at
times
as
in
the
power
bottom
is
switched
to
"
on
"
but
the
camera
does
not
respond
to
any
function
.

the
camera
only
begins
to
work
again
when
i
take
out
the
battery
and
put
it
back
in
.

did
anyone
have
this
issue
?

is
it
worthy
to
send
in
for
warranty
repair
?

thanks
!

Sounds
simple
enough
to
me
.

Your
camera
is
n't
acting
normally
,
you
got
warranty
,
let
Canon
deal
with
it
.

I
would
agree
.

I
shoot
a
t1i
and
have
n't
had
such
an
issue
.

I
also
agree
it
's
under
warranty
so
get
in
touch
with
Canon
.

It
sounds
like
a
firmware
issue
and
the
camera
requires
a
re-boot
just
like
what
happens
in
a
computer
-
needs
a
re-start
from
time
to
time
but
it
should
n't
be
happening
in
a
camera
.

Cheapest
airline
ticket
from
Raleigh
to
Philippines
?

I
'm
going
on
a
vacation
to
the
Philippines
in
May
2012
,
and
I
'm
starting
from
Raleigh
,
NC
(
RDU
Airport
)
.

Which
airlines
should
I
look
into
and
when
should
I
buy
my
ticket
?

The
sooner
the
better
but
I
'd
probably
wait
until
after
the
holidays
.

Use
Travelocity
or
Expedia
and
see
what
you
come
up
with
.

My
friend
goes
to
the
Phils
every
6
months
or
so
and
she
has
found
that
Korean
Air
has
had
the
cheapest
fares
lately
.

Raleigh
to
Chicago
,
Chicago
to
Seoul
and
then
Seoul
to
Manila
.

Compare
compare
compare
-
that
's
the
key
to
getting
the
best
deal
.

Ask
a
travel
agent
!

On
my
last
6
trips
here
from
the
states
I
used
"
Fly
genesis
"
based
in
Seattle
,
Wa
.

They
gave
the
best
service
&
rates
I
could
find
.

What
is
the
best
place
to
get
discounts
for
San
Francisco
restaurants
?

I
just
moved
into
the
city
,
and
I
'm
wondering
if
there
's
a
place
I
can
get
good
deals
on
restaurants
here
.

I
do
n't
want
to
have
to
deal
with
those
deal
-
a
-
day
websites
like
Groupon
.

I
just
want
a
simple
way
to
get
a
good
deal
to
whatever
Restaurant
I
want
,
whenever
I
want
.

Any
suggestions
would
be
really
helpful
,
thanks
!

I
usually
use
ZebraKlub
.

They
basically
buy
daily
deals
from
Groupon
,
Living
Social
,
and
all
sorts
of
other
places
.

So
you
can
pretty
much
get
whatever
deal
you
want
anytime
.

Most
of
the
deals
let
you
eat
for
500
ff
,
and
some
of
the
deals
are
even
free
.

If
you
want
to
eat
cheaply
without
worrying
about
all
those
daily
deal
emails
every
day
,
ZebraKlub
should
be
perfect
for
you
.

Where
can
I

Looking
for
something
on
the
casual
side
and
we
want
it
to
be
fun
.

May
seem
a
little
silly
,
but
,
taking
a
long
ride
on
the
Metra
system
or
the
"
L
"
system
is
a
great
way
to
see
the
city
and
sites
without
spending
a
fortune
.

Or
how
about
visiting
the
Chicago
Botanical
Gardens
and
see
the
change
of
colors
and
enjoy
the
air
,
They
also
have
many
inside
exhibits
you
might
enjoy
,
food
is
pretty
good
to
.

I
decided
to
get
a
150
gal
aquarium
,
what
can
I
fill
it
with
?

I
was
thinking
cichlids
?

Possibly
a
freshwater
tank
with
a
ton
of
different
species
in
there
.

I
've
never
kept
cichlids
though
.

I
know
saltwater
is
a
possibility
,
can
you
give
me
a
possible
stocking
option
for
that
too
?

I
'll
choose
the
one
that
sounds
the
best
after
looking
into
all
the
fish
:)

Here
is
the
stocking
for
my
150
gallon
tank
i
upgraded
it
to
200
at
the
weekend
because
of
the

If

it
would
make
a

tank
.

fill
it
with
water
:)

Thanks
Southland

Nice
little
locally
owned
greek
bar
and
grill
.

Good
food
.

Great
wings
!

Do
n't
bother
.

It
's
impossible
to
understand
how
this
place
has
survived
.

The
finest
German
bedding
and
linens
store
.

Quality
and
service
come
first
here
.

Place
is
legit
.

We
got
upgraded
to
a
corner
suite
!

Room
was
amazing
.

hard
to
forgive
such
an
awful
margarita
and
steep
prices
but
the
food
can
be
good

this

Drove
all
the
way
over
from
the

...
closed

Who
does
that
?!

You
are
the
only
one

shop
in
the
area
I
would
count
on
.

Great
job
on
my
roof
and
the

Will
use
again
in
the
future
.

They
treat

that

will
extend
the

politeness
to

customers
.

absolutely
fantastic

getting

iphone
upgraded
at

...

Sheer
contrast
to
getting
it
done
at

which
is
done
under

Decent
place
to
stay

I
would
stay

plenty
of

Best
Electrician
in
Florence

I
have
been
using
Steele
Electric
for
years
.

They
have
always
done
a
great
job
at
a
reasonable
price
.

Highly
recommended
.

Not
impressed
.

Overpriced
and
the
doctor
acted
arrogant
and
rushed
at
a
time
when
there
was
very
few
clients
in
the
facility
.

I
wo
n't
return
.

A
thoroughly
comprehensive
service
;
excellent
communication
and
best
of
they
are
transparent
with
their
fee
(
ie
nothing
is
simply
implied
or
assumed
)
.

I
gave
Dr.
Rohatgi
2
stars
because
her
assistant
was
very
pleasant
.

However
,
I
did
not
find
her
very
helpful
and
her
receptionist
was
rude
.

Extremely
greasy
.

Hit
or
miss
on
the
service
.

My
fries
were
n't
fully
cooked
last
time
I
went
there
.

Pretty
spendy
for
really
not
great
quality

The
management
and
staff
are
superb
.

I
worked
with
Sam
Mones
who
took
great
care
of
me
.

This
is
by
far
the
best
run
dealership
in
Miami
.

The
company
gets
busy
but
you
never
have
to
wait
long
because
they
ARE
orginizied
,
so
you
are
in
,
out
,
and
paid
well
for
your
scrap

still
hungry

Worst

place
had
the
worst
tasting
pizza
I
have
ever

it
was
possible
the

I
've

I
do
n't
recommend
this

to
anyone
or
even
anything
to
eat
.

Not
so
good

Not
worth
the
money
.

Bland
and
over
cooked

I
felt
as
if
I
was
in
an
over

Olive

I
was

to
have
found

place

not

I
'm
pleased
that
someone
referred
me
to
them

I

Cleanest

have
been

Stayed
here
for
2
nights
.

The
owner
was
very
friendly
and
helpful
.

The
rooms
were
very
clean
and
the
breakfast
was
excellent
.

Good
location
and
off
road
parking
made
our
stay
very
convenient
.

These
guys
do
great
work
at
VERY
reasonable
prices
.

I
have
use
them
four
times
for
fixing
items
from
pushing
out
a
dent
in
a
bumper
to
fixing
the
fender
on
my
beloved
Miata
.

I
have
never
been
disappointed

Do

The

he
has
a

behind
the
bar
where
he
can
delete
songs
he
does
n't
like
,
and
you
end
up
paying

it

Great
place

Really
great
service
and
kind

.

The
haircut
was
inexpensive
and
so
were
the

(
eyebrows
were
cheap
!
)
.

It
's
a
nice
,
relaxed
place
to
get
stuff
done
and
relax
.

I
plan
on
going
again
.

Amazing
customer
service

I
think
the
women
at
this
salon
know
that
their
business
is
based
primarily
from
referrals
.
:)

They
were
amazingly
hospitable
.

Edit
was
the
best

I
've
ever
had
and
I
would
HIGHLY
recommend
her

great

I
was
with
verizon
and
I
checked
my
service
with

and
it
was
great
so
I
thought
I
would
try

It
turned
out
being
very
good

I
was

BEST
DENTIST
EVER
-

Very
fast
and
efficient
service
.

I
have
had
several
dentists
in
my
life
,
but
Dr.
Deters
is
by
far
my
favorite
.

I
never
wait
in
the
waiting
room
more
than
two
minutes
and
the
cleanings
are
quick
and
painless
.

This
is
a
great
place
to
shop
.

I
've
been
a
regular
customer
at
this
store
since
it
opened
,
and
love
the
fact
that
all
of
the
employees
are
friendly
locals
.

Particularly
the
lady
who
operates
the
front
register
,
she
's
very
kind
!

AMAZING

Great

The

is
easy
to

and
it
keeps
the
cold
out

The
sales

and
the

were
all
easy
to
get
along
with
.

I

okay
,
I
do
nt
have
a
review
,
but
why
in
the
hell
would
you
name
your
business
something
that
has
the
initials
KKK
....
is
there
something
behind
the
scenes
at
this
place
?

Like
I

Fresh
and
Excellent
Quality

We
order
take
out
from
here
all
the
time
and
we
are
never
disappointed
.

The
food
is
always
fresh
and
delicious
.

It
can
be
a
little
on
the
spicy
side
but
just
ask
them
exactly
what
you
want
and
they
are
very
helpful
.

I
really
want
to
like
this
place
since
I
work
right
around
the
corner
.

Unfortunately
,
I
've
given
it
a
couple
of
tries
at
different
times
and
decided
to
stop
going
.

The
employees
do
n't
really
seem
to
enjoy
what
they
are
doing
and
it
shows
.

Class
act
.

It
was
late
in
the
day
and
I
was
worried
I
would
get
charged
an
arm
and
a
leg
and
have
to
wait
forever
.

They
picked
my
car
up
in
Yarmouth
and
towed
to
Bath
for
a
great
price
.

Would
do
business
with
them
again
.

Great

We
at
R&L

you
will
be
our
first
call
if
anything
happens
again

we
will

very
easy

They
walked
me
through
all
the
steps
involved
in
the
the
installation
project
so
that
there
were
no
surprises
.

I
found
them
extremely
professional
and
would
highly
recommend
them
.

Thanks

slow
service

I
used
to
take
my
cars
there
all
the
time
,
but
management
changes
hands
too
frequently
,
the
service
has
been
slow
,
and
they
often
try
to
"
add
on
"
extra
services
,
which
sometimes
is
not
needed
.

I
do
nt
go
there
anymore

Great
service

These
people
were
so
helpful
this

and
did
everything
to

It

sorted
with
no

at

and
I
'm

and
hopefully
you

I
hired
this

to

The
price
they
gave
was
good
so
I
said
hey
this
seems
great
.

After
they
showed
up
there
was
a
little
trouble
to
get

it

quite

Bulwark
regarding

by
Eric

Just
wanted
you
to
know
that
Eric
came
by
as
scheduled
today
and
sprayed
our
house
for
scorpions
.

He
seemed
to
understand
how
important
it
was
for
us
to
make
sure
the
whole
house
was
sprayed
so
he
took
his
time
.

Thank
you
!

I

My

I

I

and
deathly
slow

I
have
eaten
here
several
times
and
every
time
the

is
slower

slow
.

One
time
we
even
left
after
sitting
at
the
table
for
20
minutes
and
not
being
greeted
with

There

Last

I
went

,
my

the

was
so
-
so
.

I
get
that
careless

perhaps
they

The
prevalence
of
discrimination
across
racial
groups
in
contemporary
America
:

Results
from
a
nationally
representative
sample
of
adults

Introduction
.

Personal
experiences
of
discrimination
and
bias
have
been
the
focus
of
much
social
science
research
.
[
1
-
3
]

Sociologists
have
explored
the
adverse
consequences
of
discrimination
[
3
–
5
]
;

psychologists
have
examined
the
mental
processes
that
underpin
conscious
and
unconscious
biases
[
6
]
;

neuroscientists
have
examined
the
neurobiological
underpinnings
of
discrimination
[
7
–
9
]
;

and
evolutionary
theorists
have
explored
the
various
ways
that
in-group
/
out-group
biases
emerged
across
the
history
of
our
species
.
[
10
]

In
many
respects
,
researchers
already
possess
a
wealth
of
knowledge
concerning
the
origins
and
consequences
of
discrimination
and
bias
.
[
11
]

What
also
should
not
be
lost
in
discussion
of
discrimination
is
the
growing
push
to
implement
social
policy
aimed
at
reducing
the
occurrence
of
discriminatory
practices
.

Mandatory
diversity
trainings
in
professional
settings
,
for
example
,
are
intended
to
reduce
bias
in
the
workplace
by
increasing
the
awareness
of
employees
regarding
the
challenges
facing
minority
group
members
.
[
12
]

Indeed
,
the
implementation
of
certain
policies
is
rooted
in
the
assumption
that
discrimination
and
biases
are
,
at
least
to
some
appreciable
amount
,
present
in
modern
society
.

Even
so
,
estimates
of
the
prevalence
of
perceived
discrimination
remains
rare
(
see
[
13
–
14
]
)
.

At
least
one
prior
study
by
Kessler
and
colleagues
[
15
]
,
however
,
using
measures
of
perceived
discrimination
in
a
large
American
sample
,
reported
that
approximately
33
%
of
respondents
reported
some
form
of
discrimination
(
see
also
,
Gibbons
et
al.
[
4
]
)
.

The
current
study
seeks
to
build
on
this
research
by
estimating
the
prevalence
of
discrimination
experiences
among
a
large
,
nationally
representative
sample
of
adults
from
the
United
States
.

Additionally
,
the
analysis
address
the
perceived
reasons
for
reported
discrimination
experiences
.

Reason
for
discrimination
.

All
respondents
who
indicated
they
were
discriminated
against
—
specifically
,
those
who
responded
with
sometimes
or
often
to
the
perceived
discrimination
measure
described
above
—
were
asked
the
following
question
:

“
What
do
you
think
was
the
main
reason
for
these
experiences
?
”

Respondents
were
allowed
to
choose
one
response
from
11
categories
.

For
the
present
analysis
,
these
responses
were
recoded
into
nine
mutually
exclusive
categories
capturing
the
following
options
:

race
/
ancestry
/
skin
color
;

gender
;

age
;

religion
;

height
or
weight
;

sexual
orientation
;

education
or
income
;

physical
disability
;

and
other
.

The
following
categories
from
the
original
questionnaire
were
collapsed
into
one
category
for
the
analysis
:
race
;
ancestry
or
national
origin
;
and
shade
of
skin
color
.

Additionally
,
because
this
question
was
only
asked
of
respondents
who
reported
prior
discrimination
experiences
,
the
built-in
skip
pattern
resulted
in
a
large
number
of
cases
scored
as
missing
(
legitimate
skip
)
.

Respondent
race
.

Because
a
race
variable
is
not
available
from
the
Wave
4
interviews
,
we
use
the
racial
category
reported
by
the
respondent
during
the
Wave
1
interview
.

Wave
1
race
—
rather
than
,
say
,
Wave
3
race
—
was
used
to
preserve
case
counts
.

The
logic
is
that
(
nearly
)
all
Wave
4
respondents
appeared
in
the
Wave
1
sample
,
but
not
all
would
have
been
interviewed
at
Wave
3
due
to
differential
patterns
of
temporary
attrition
.

Respondents
were
asked
to
indicate
their
race
from
among
the
following
categories
:
White
;
Black
or
African
American
;
Hispanic
;
American
Indian
or
Native
American
;
and
Asian
or
Pacific
Islander
.

Respondents
were
provided
the
opportunity
to
select
more
than
one
race
,
and
those
who
did
were
asked
a
follow-up
question
regarding
which
category
best
described
their
racial
background
.

In
the
current
study
,
those
respondents
who
indicated
more
than
one
race
were
coded
as
“
mixed
race
”
.

Demographic
variables
.

To
provide
information
on
the
analytical
sample
as
a
whole
,
two
additional
demographic
variables
are
included
.

First
,
age
is
a
continuous
measure
created
by
subtracting
the
year
of
the
respondents
'
birth
(
obtained
from
Wave
1
)
from
the
year
of
the
interview
at
Wave
4
.

Second
,
sex
was
dichotomously
coded
based
on
the
self-reported
sex
of
the
respondent
at
Wave
4
(
0
=
female
and
1
=
male
)
.

Analytical
plan
.

Our
exploratory
study
included
three
basic
steps
.

First
,
summary
statistics
of
the
study
variables
and
racial
categories
were
produced
.

Second
,
we
examined
the
relative
proportions
of
the
two
discrimination
experience
measures
across
each
racial
category
.

Finally
,
we
assessed
the
distribution
of
reported
reasons
for
discrimination
across
the
racial
categories
.

In
order
to
examine
potential
bivariate
associations
,
the
adjusted
F
statistic
(
design-based
F
)
was
employed
as
it
corrects
for
a
complex
sample
design
such
as
that
used
in
the
Add
Health
.
[
21
]

More
specifically
,
when
analyzing
weighted
sample
data
employing
the
svy
suite
of
commands
in
Stata
the
conventional
Pearson
χ2
statistic
test
of
independence
is
converted
into
“
an
F
statistic
with
noninteger
degrees
of
freedom
by
using
a
second-order
Rao
and
Scott
(
1981
[
22
]
,
1984
[
23
]
)
correction
”
.
[
24
]

The
p-value
associated
with
the
design-based
F
is
thus
more
accurate
(
than
the
associated
with
the
χ2
statistic
)
given
the
adjustments
and
calculations
take
into
account
the
weighted
nature
of
the
data
.

This
final
step
also
included
an
examination
of
the
relative
distribution
of
racial
categories
across
the
various
reported
reasons
for
discrimination
.

As
noted
earlier
,
all
analyses
were
weighted
according
to
the
survey
weight
provided
by
the
Add
Health
research
staff
and
standard
errors
were
corrected
for
the
clustering
and
stratification
that
defined
the
sampling
strategy
.

Thus
,
all
estimates
reported
here
can
be
considered
nationally
representative
of
the
United
States
.

GUJJOLAAY
EEGIMAA
,
ITS
SPEAKERS
AND
THEIR
NEIGHBOURS

This
section
briefly
presents
the
Gújjolaay
Eegimaa
(
Eegimaa
for
short
;
Ethnologue
code
:
ISO
639-3
:
bqj
)
,
its
speakers
and
its
varieties
.

We
also
discuss
aspects
of
the
contact
situation
of
the
Eegimaa
language
.

This
is
important
,
because
as
we
will
show
in
§
6
below
,
some
of
the
Eegimaa
death
prevention
names
and
child-bearing
names
are
given
to
Eegimaa
people
from
other
communities
.

Eegimaa
is
a
Jóola
language
spoken
in
the
Basse
Casamance
area
of
Southern
Senegal
by
a
population
estimated
to
be
between
7,000
(
Bassène
,
2007
)
and
11,200
speakers
(
Lewis
,
Simons
,
&
Fennig
,
2014
)
.

Jóola
languages
are
classified
as
members
of
Sapir
’s
(
1971
)
BAK
group
of
Atlantic
languages
of
the
Niger
Congo
language
phylum
.

Speakers
of
these
languages
are
found
in
the
Gambia
,
in
the
former
Casamance
region
of
Southern
Senegal
and
in
Guinea
Bissau
.

The
map
in
Figure
1
,
taken
from
Ethnologue
,
presents
the
languages
of
Senegal
.

The
arrow
on
the
map
points
to
the
Eegimaa
speaking
area
(
Bandial
is
the
name
used
by
Ethnologue
for
Eegimaa
)
.

Eegimaa
is
mainly
spoken
in
Mof-Ávvi
,
a
former
kingdom
of
10
villages
located
to
the
west
of
Ziguinchor
,
the
capital
city
of
the
former
administrative
region
of
Casamance
in
the
south
of
Senegal
.

Mof-Ávvi
is
a
peninsula
bordered
by
the
Casamance
River
to
the
north
,
which
separates
it
from
the
Jóola
Búluf
and
Jóola
Fogny
areas
,
and
to
the
east
by
the
villages
Brin
and
Djibonker
,
where
the
speakers
of
Kujireray
and
Baïnounk
Gubëeher
live
.

In
the
south
,
the
river
known
as
Kamobeul
Bolon
separates
Mof-Ávvi
from
the
Bayot
speaking
area
,
while
the
west
side
of
Mof-Ávvi
coincides
with
the
homeland
of
the
Jóola
Kaasa
Húluf
and
Jóola
Kaasa
Ésuulaaluʔ
.

The
map
in
Figure
2
below
,
adapted
from
Palmeri
and
Gazio
(
1995
)
,
shows
a
very
approximate
location
of
Mof-Ávvi
in
relation
to
other
neighbouring
speech
communities
.

Some
of
these
communities
will
be
referred
to
in
our
discussion
of
death
prevention
names
in
§
6
.

The
Eegimaa
spoken
in
Mof-Ávvi
is
known
by
several
names
given
by
speakers
of
neighbouring
languages
.

For
example
,
the
name
Kusiilay
1
‘
the
language
of
Essil
’
,
is
the
name
given
by
speakers
of
Kujireray
to
the
Eegimaa
language
,
because
Essil
,
of
which
Bajjat
was
a
district
,
is
the
village
which
has
a
border
with
their
village
.

Endungo
is
the
name
given
by
Bayot
speakers
,
but
its
meaning
is
not
known
.

Kúlaakiay
,
‘
the
language
of
village
of
Seleki
/
Sállagi
’
,
is
the
name
given
by
Jóola
Kaasa
speakers
who
are
more
familiar
with
the
village
of
Seleki
/
Sállagi
’
than
all
other
villages
of
Mof-Ávvi
.

Finally
,
Banjal
/
Bandial
‘
the
language
of
the
village
of
Banjal
’
,
the
most
popular
of
all
those
names
,
is
the
name
given
by
the
Jóola
Búluf
and
Jóola
Fogny
speakers
to
Eegimaa
people
and
their
language
,
because
people
from
the
village
of
Banjal
were
the
first
to
be
in
contact
with
them
.

Village
names
are
written
using
their
usual
spelling
.

The
Ethnologue
language
codes
are
provided
for
language
varieties
that
have
them
.

Language
names
are
written
following
the
recommendation
for
the
transcription
of
national
languages
of
Senegal
,
Decree
2005-981
.

Names
of
the
villages
of
Mof-Ávvi
are
written
using
the
Eegimaa
orthography
and
following
the
pronunciation
of
village
names
by
native
speakers
.

Jóola
language
varieties
which
are
closely
related
to
Eegimaa
include
Kujireray
/
Kuluunaay
(
from
the
village
of
Brin
with
76
%
lexical
similarity
)
and
Gufiñamay
(
from
the
village
of
Afiniam
with
74
%
lexical
similarity
(
based
on
Lewis
et
al.
,
2014
eds.
)
)
.

Gútaamay
(
from
the
village
of
Butam
)
,
Gulapaoray
(
from
the
village
Djilapaor
)
and
Gusiilay
(
ISO
639-3
:
bsl
)
from
the
village
of
Thionk
Essil
are
also
other
languages
related
to
Eegimaa
.

They
are
located
north
of
the
Casamance
River
in
the
Jóola
Búluf
area
.

There
are
also
small
migrant
Eegimaa
communities
in
villages
like
Djifanghor
(
east
of
Ziguinchor
)
and
in
Bourofaye
(
south
of
Ziguinchor
)
,
where
they
cohabit
with
speakers
of
Baïnounk
languages
.

Nowadays
most
Eegimaa
speakers
from
Mof-Ávvi
live
outside
their
homeland
,
generally
in
urban
areas
like
Ziguinchor
and
Dakar
.

Speakers
of
Eegimaa
use
the
term
Gújjolaay
(
meaning
Jóola
)
to
refer
to
their
language
when
they
speak
to
each
other
,
but
Eegimaa
to
distinguish
their
Jóola
variety
from
that
of
other
Jóola
peoples
.

Eegimaa
is
an
endangered
language
whose
transmission
to
new
generations
has
been
declining
significantly
in
the
last
decades
.

It
is
important
to
understand
the
contact
situation
of
Eegimaa
,
because
some
of
the
ritual
names
analysed
in
this
paper
come
from
other
languages
or
from
neighbouring
communities
.

These
names
are
given
either
in
Eegimaa
or
in
a
different
language
.

Antonín
Dvořák

Antonín
Leopold
Dvořák
(
/
d(ə)ˈvɔːrʒɑːk
,
-ʒæk
/
d(ə)-VOR-zha(h)k
;
Czech
:
[
ˈantoɲiːn
ˈlɛopolt
ˈdvor̝aːk
]
;
8
September
1841
–
1
May
1904
)
was
a
Czech
composer
.

After
Bedřich
Smetana
,
he
was
the
next
Czech
Romantic-era
composer
to
achieve
worldwide
recognition
.

Following
Smetana
's
nationalist
example
,
Dvořák
frequently
employed
aspects
,
specifically
rhythms
,
of
the
folk
music
of
Moravia
and
his
native
Bohemia
.

Dvořák
's
own
style
has
been
described
as
"
the
fullest
recreation
of
a
national
idiom
with
that
of
the
symphonic
tradition
,
absorbing
folk
influences
and
finding
effective
ways
of
using
them
"
.
[

Antonín
Dvořák

Dvořák
displayed
his
musical
gifts
at
an
early
age
,
being
an
apt
violin
student
from
age
six
.

The
first
public
performances
of
his
works
were
in
Prague
in
1872
and
,
with
special
success
,
in
1873
,
when
he
was
aged
31
.

Seeking
recognition
beyond
the
Prague
area
,
he
submitted
a
score
of
his
First
Symphony
to
a
prize
competition
in
Germany
,
but
did
not
win
,
and
the
unreturned
manuscript
was
lost
until
rediscovered
many
decades
later
.

In
1874
he
made
a
submission
to
the
Austrian
State
Prize
for
Composition
,
including
scores
of
two
further
symphonies
and
other
works
.

Although
Dvořák
was
not
aware
of
it
,
Johannes
Brahms
was
the
leading
member
of
the
jury
and
was
highly
impressed
.

The
prize
was
awarded
to
Dvořák
in
1874
[
a
]
and
again
in
1876
and
in
1877
,
when
Brahms
and
the
prominent
critic
Eduard
Hanslick
,
also
a
member
of
the
jury
,
made
themselves
known
to
him
.

Brahms
recommended
Dvořák
to
his
publisher
,
Simrock
,
who
soon
afterward
commissioned
what
became
the
Slavonic
Dances
,
Op.
46
.

These
were
highly
praised
by
the
Berlin
music
critic
Louis
Ehlert
in
1878
,
the
sheet
music
(
of
the
original
piano
4-hands
version
)
had
excellent
sales
,
and
Dvořák
's
international
reputation
was
launched
at
last
.

Dvořák
's
first
piece
of
a
religious
nature
,
his
setting
of
Stabat
Mater
,
was
premiered
in
Prague
in
1880
.

It
was
very
successfully
performed
in
London
in
1883
,
leading
to
many
other
performances
in
the
United
Kingdom
and
United
States
.
[
2
]

In
his
career
,
Dvořák
made
nine
invited
visits
to
England
,
often
conducting
performances
of
his
own
works
.

His
Seventh
Symphony
was
written
for
London
.

Visiting
Russia
in
March
1890
,
he
conducted
concerts
of
his
own
music
in
Moscow
and
Saint
Petersburg
.
[
3
]

In
1891
Dvořák
was
appointed
as
a
professor
at
the
Prague
Conservatory
.

In
1890
–
91
,
he
wrote
his
Dumky
Trio
,
one
of
his
most
successful
chamber
music
pieces
.

In
1892
,
Dvořák
moved
to
the
United
States
and
became
the
director
of
the
National
Conservatory
of
Music
of
America
in
New
York
City
.

While
in
the
United
States
,
Dvořák
wrote
his
two
most
successful
orchestral
works
:
the
Symphony
From
the
New
World
,
which
spread
his
reputation
worldwide
,
[
4
]
and
his
Cello
Concerto
,
one
of
the
most
highly
regarded
of
all
cello
concerti
.

He
also
wrote
his
most
appreciated
piece
of
chamber
music
,
the
American
String
Quartet
,
during
this
time
.

But
shortfalls
in
payment
of
his
salary
,
along
with
increasing
recognition
in
Europe
and
an
onset
of
homesickness
,
led
him
to
leave
the
United
States
and
return
to
Bohemia
in
1895
.

All
of
Dvořák
's
nine
operas
but
his
first
have
librettos
in
Czech
and
were
intended
to
convey
Czech
national
spirit
,
as
were
some
of
his
choral
works
.

By
far
the
most
successful
of
the
operas
is
Rusalka
.

Among
his
smaller
works
,
the
seventh
Humoresque
and
the
song
"
Songs
My
Mother
Taught
Me
"
are
also
widely
performed
and
recorded
.

He
has
been
described
as
"
arguably
the
most
versatile
...
composer
of
his
time
"

Otto
Jespersen

Jens
Otto
Harry
Jespersen
or
Otto
Jespersen
(
Danish
:
[
ʌtˢo
ˈjɛsb̥ɐsn̩
]
;
16
July
1860
–
30
April
1943
)
was
a
Danish
linguist
who
specialized
in
the
grammar
of
the
English
language
.

Early
life

Otto
Jespersen
was
born
in
Randers
in
Jutland
.

He
was
inspired
by
the
work
of
Danish
philologist
Rasmus
Rask
as
a
boy
,
and
with
the
help
of
Rask
's
grammars
taught
himself
some
Icelandic
,
Italian
,
and
Spanish
.

He
entered
the
University
of
Copenhagen
in
1877
when
he
was
17
,
initially
studying
law
but
not
forgetting
his
language
studies
.

In
1881
he
shifted
his
focus
completely
to
languages
,
and
in
1887
earned
his
master
's
degree
in
French
,
with
English
and
Latin
as
his
secondary
languages
.

He
supported
himself
during
his
studies
through
part-time
work
as
a
schoolteacher
and
as
a
shorthand
reporter
in
the
Danish
parliament
.

In
1887
–
1888
,
he
traveled
to
England
,
Germany
and
France
,
meeting
linguists
like
Henry
Sweet
and
Paul
Passy
and
attending
lectures
at
institutions
like
Oxford
University
.

Following
the
advice
of
his
mentor
Vilhelm
Thomsen
,
he
returned
to
Copenhagen
in
August
1888
and
began
work
on
his
doctoral
dissertation
on
the
English
case
system
.

He
successfully
defended
his
dissertation
in
1891
.

Academic
life
and
work

Jespersen
was
a
professor
of
English
at
the
University
of
Copenhagen
from
1893
to
1925
,
and
served
as
Rector
of
the
university
in
1920
–
21
.

His
early
work
focused
primarily
on
language
teaching
reform
and
on
phonetics
,
but
he
is
best
known
for
his
later
work
on
syntax
and
on
language
development
.

He
advanced
the
theories
of
Rank
and
Nexus
in
Danish
in
two
papers
:
Sprogets
logik
(
1913
)
and
De
to
hovedarter
af
grammatiske
forbindelser
(
1921
)
.

Jespersen
in
this
theory
of
ranks
removes
the
parts
of
speech
from
the
syntax
,
and
differentiates
between
primaries
,
secondaries
,
and
tertiaries
;
e.g.
in
"
well
honed
phrase
,
"
"
phrase
"
is
a
primary
,
this
being
defined
by
a
secondary
,
"
honed
"
,
which
again
is
defined
by
a
tertiary
"
well
"
.

The
term
Nexus
is
applied
to
sentences
,
structures
similar
to
sentences
and
sentences
in
formation
,
in
which
two
concepts
are
expressed
in
one
unit
;
e.g.
,
it
rained
,
he
ran
indoors
.

This
term
is
qualified
by
a
further
concept
called
a
junction
which
represents
one
idea
,
expressed
by
means
of
two
or
more
elements
,
whereas
a
nexus
combines
two
ideas
.

Junction
and
nexus
proved
valuable
in
bringing
the
concept
of
context
to
the
forefront
of
the
attention
of
the
world
of
linguistics
.

He
was
most
widely
recognized
for
some
of
his
books
.

Language
:
Its
Nature
,
Development
and
Origin
(
1922
)
is
considered
by
many
to
be
his
masterpiece
.

Modern
English
Grammar
on
Historical
Principles
(
1909
–
1949
)
,
concentrated
on
morphology
and
syntax
,
and
Growth
and
Structure
of
the
English
Language
(
1905
)
is
a
comprehensive
view
of
English
by
someone
with
another
native
language
,
and
still
in
print
,
over
70
years
after
his
death
and
more
than
100
years
after
publication
.

Late
in
his
life
he
published
Analytic
Syntax
(
1937
)
,
in
which
he
presents
his
views
on
syntactic
structure
using
an
idiosyncratic
shorthand
notation
.

In
The
Philosophy
of
Grammar
(
1924
)
he
challenged
the
accepted
views
of
common
concepts
in
Grammar
and
proposed
corrections
to
the
basic
definitions
of
grammatical
case
,
pronoun
,
object
,
voice
etc.
,
and
developed
further
his
notions
of
Rank
and
Nexus
.

In
the
21st
century
this
book
is
still
used
as
one
of
the
basic
texts
in
modern
Structural
linguistics
.

Mankind
,
Nation
and
Individual
:
from
a
linguistic
point
of
view
(
1925
)
is
one
of
the
pioneering
works
on
Sociolinguistics
.

Jespersen
visited
the
United
States
twice
:

he
lectured
at
the
Congress
of
Arts
and
Sciences
in
St.
Louis
in
1904
,
and
in
1909
–
1910
he
visited
both
the
University
of
California
and
Columbia
University
.

While
in
the
U.S.
,
he
took
occasion
to
study
the
country
's
educational
system
.

His
autobiography
(
see
below
)
was
published
in
English
translation
as
recently
as
1995
.

Jespersen
was
a
proponent
of
phonosemanticism
and
wrote
:

“
Is
there
really
much
more
logic
in
the
opposite
extreme
which
denies
any
kind
of
sound
symbolism
(
apart
from
the
small
class
of
evident
echoisms
and
‘
onomatopoeia
’
)
and
sees
in
our
words
only
a
collection
of
accidental
and
irrational
associations
of
sound
and
meaning
?
...

There
is
no
denying
that
there
are
words
which
we
feel
instinctively
to
be
adequate
to
express
the
ideas
they
stand
for
.
”

After
his
retirement
in
1925
,
Jespersen
remained
active
in
the
international
linguistic
community
.

In
addition
to
continuing
to
write
,
he
convened
and
chaired
the
first
International
Meeting
on
Linguistic
Research
in
Geneva
in
1930
,
and
acted
as
president
of
the
Fourth
International
Congress
of
Linguists
in
Copenhagen
in
1936
.

Jespersen
was
an
important
figure
in
the
international
language
movement
.

He
was
an
early
supporter
of
the
Esperanto
offshoot
Ido
and
in
1927
published
his
own
project
Novial
.

He
also
worked
with
the
International
Auxiliary
Language
Association
.

Jespersen
received
honorary
degrees
from
Columbia
University
in
New
York
(
1910
)
,
St.
Andrews
University
in
Scotland
(
1925
)
,
and
the
Sorbonne
in
Paris
(
1927
)
.

He
was
one
of
the
first
six
international
scholars
to
be
elected
as
honorary
members
of
the
Linguistic
Society
of
America
.

Falling

You
’re
on
the
236th-level
Kaiserstrasse
moving
sidewalk
when
you
see
her
.

You
’re
leaning
on
the
railing
,
waiting
to
ask
Derya
about
a
job
,
watching
the
glittering
stream
of
mites
that
arc
over
half
the
sky
—
flying
up
to
rewind
their
nanosprings
in
the
stratospheric
sunlight
,
flying
down
to
make
Frankfurt
run
.

You
never
get
tired
of
watching
them
.

She
’s
on
the
Holbeinsteg
bridge
.

Someone
’s
hung
it
up
here
—
a
hundred
meters
of
clean
gray
and
green
twentieth-century
modernism
,
plucked
up
from
the
river
Main
and
suspended
in
the
chilly
air
2,360
meters
up
,
between
a
lump
of
wooded
parkland
and
a
cluster
of
antique
subway
cars
.

She
’s
wearing
a
1950s
sundress
and
a
broad-brimmed
hat
,
and
it
’s
like
an
essay
on
the
last
century
—
the
austere
steel
bridge
,
the
bright
blobs
of
subway
graffiti
,
and
her
yellow
dress
,
flapping
against
her
legs
as
she
climbs
over
the
bridge
’s
rail
.

A
picture
of
elegance
and
style
from
the
age
of
money
,
violence
,
and
simplicity
.

She
’s
a
strawberry
blonde
,
slim
,
her
skin
blank
and
virginal
as
new
butter
.

She
’s
beyond
the
rail
now
,
hanging
out
over
the
mountain
-
high
drop
.

Thin
translucent
shadows
move
across
her
—
the
shadows
of
the
neosilk-and-nanotube
filaments
that
hang
the
city
from
the
hundreds
of
five-kilometer-high
towers
that
encircle
it
.

(
A
civic
agent
notices
you
noticing
,
and
attaches
itself
to
your
infospace
,
whispering
statistics
—

“
Each
object
’s
suspension
must
weather
a
class
5
hurricane
and
the
destruction
of
80
%
of
the
towers
”
—

“
Frankfurt
’s
current
population
is
stable
at
53
million
”
—

“
Average
age
62
,
birth
rate
0.22
,
net
immigration
of
half
a
million
a
year
”
—

“
Current
personal
squatright
:
311
cubic
meters
per
resident
”
—

until
you
brush
it
away
.
)

You
’re
watching
her
lean
out
.

The
wind
whips
her
hair
,
ruffles
the
skirt
around
her
knees
.

She
must
be
a
tourist
.

You
remember
your
first
trip
to
the
upper
levels
:
leaning
over
the
edge
into
the
angry
swarm
of
mites
,
whirring
and
buzzing
warnings
and
shoving
you
back
like
a
million
mosquito
chaperones
.

Everyone
tries
it
once
—
Except
that
there
are
n’t
any
mites
around
her
.

You
clutch
the
railing
.

Hot
,
animal
fear
surges
in
your
chest
.

She
looks
up
at
you
and
,
across
the
gap
of
forty
meters
,
smiles
a
brilliant
,
heartbreaking
smile
.

Then
she
lets
go
and
falls
.

You
scream
.

“
Fucking
airsurfers
,
”
says
Derya
.

He
steps
off
the
moving
sidewalk
near
you
:
tall
,
hook-nosed
,
the
fashionable
whorls
of
pox
and
acne
making
constellations
of
his
cheeks
and
chest
;
the
glowing
,
formal
tattoos
of
his
committees
and
lifebrands
adorning
his
massive
triceps
.

You
swallow
on
a
dry
throat
.

Derya
,
of
all
people
,
hearing
you
scream
!

He
gives
you
a
hooded
look
.

“
They
infect
themselves
with
some
designer
virus
-

it
lets
them
hack
the
city
’s
person-recognition
systems
.

So
the
mites
do
n’t
see
them
when
they
jump
.

Watch
—
”

She
’s
swept
past
the
whalelike
oval
of
the
public
pool
on
the
202nd
,
past
the
sloping
mandala
of
the
Google
of
offices
on
the
164th
.

At
the
131st
,
below
her
,
is
the
old
Stock
Exchange
,
hung
upside-down
now
as
a
hipster
den
.

Now
the
mites
are
finally
closing
in
.

A
silver
swarm
coalesces
around
the
164th
,
and
she
vanishes
into
it
,
like
a
snip
of
scallion
into
cloudy
miso
soup
.

When
the
cloud
disperses
,
she
’s
standing
on
one
of
the
Stock
Exchange
’s
upside-down
overhangs
.

She
waves
,
antlike
,
then
crawls
through
a
dormer
window
.

“
It
’s
not
funny
,
”
Derya
says
.

“
They
’re
a
huge
drain
on
emergency
preparedness
.

Ripple
effects
are
causing
project
slowdowns
...
”

“
Freeloaders
drive
systemic
evolution
,
”
you
find
yourself
saying
.

“
Do
n’t
you
quote
the
founders
at
me
,
”
Derya
snaps
.

“
The
Free
Society
is
fragile
.

The
minute
enough
people
find
anticontributive
behavior
cool
,
the
party
’s
over
—

it
’s
back
to
capitalist
competition
or
state
control
.
”

He
stares
until
you
meet
his
eye
.

“
You
even
talk
to
those
people
-

are
you
paying
attention
?
—

you
even
talk
to
them
,
your
rep
will
be
trashed
on
all
the
major
servers
.

You
wo
n’t
work
,
you
wo
n’t
party
,
you
’ll
be
defriended
by
every
one
of
your
tribes
.

Got
it
?
”

Her
broad-brimmed
hat
is
still
sailing
on
the
wind
.

The
mites
missed
it
.

It
cuts
between
the
towers
of
the
50th
.

The
upside-down
trading
floor
is
deserted
.

There
are
heaps
of
yellowed
euros
and
deutschmarks
dumped
here
,
like
snowdrifts
.

Wood
panel
,
marble
.

Silence
.

And
the
air
is
strangely
clear
.

You
realize
:
no
mites
.

The
city
has
no
eyes
or
ears
here
.

You
walk
through
empty
,
miteless
rooms
,
stepping
around
light
fixtures
.

Then
she
’s
there
,
in
a
doorway
.

Her
eyes
,
bright
blue
,
radiant
.

Her
smile
,
with
that
chaste
yellow
dress
,
so
bashful
.

She
comes
to
you
.

“
You
want
it
?
”
she
says
.

“
You
want
to
be
infected
?

You
want
to
fly
?
”

You
nod
.

Eyes
closing
,
she
leans
in
for
the
kiss
.

Perfect
Teeth

Steven
wanted
to
be
a
dentist
.

It
was
pretty
much
the
first
thing
he
told
us
when
,
as
first
years
,
we
were
all
bunched
together
in
the
unfamiliar
dusty
classroom
.

When
,
a
couple
of
weeks
later
we
were
invited
over
to
his
house
we
saw
that
this
was
not
an
idle
remark
.

Where
our
bedroom
walls
were
decorated
with
posters
of
pop
stars
and
footballers
,
Steven
had
diagrams
setting
out
tooth
implementations
,
anatomical
drawings
of
the
jaw
with
brightly
coloured
nerves
,
muscle
,
blood
vessels
,
bones
,
and
,
of
course
,
teeth
.

Where
we
had
shelves
of
plastic
dinosaurs
and
superhero
figurines
from
cornflake
boxes
,
Steven
had
plaster
casts
of
jawbones
,
gums
and
teeth
grinning
down
at
us
.

The
instruments
were
locked
away
in
glass
cabinets
and
only
his
parents
had
the
key
.

“
They
do
n’t
exactly
encourage
my
interest
,
”
he
shrugged
.

“
They
sort
of
tolerate
it
.

But
Dad
says
they
’re
a
sort
of
collection
,
and
too
expensive
for
me
to
play
with
.
”

Of
course
,
we
tried
to
pick
the
locks
,
but
the
spikes
and
saws
and
drillheads
remained
—
tantalisingly
—
out
of
reach
.

We
did
n’t
see
Steven
’s
interest
as
strange
,
well
,
not
that
much
.

We
all
had
our
own
interests
—
drawing
,
electronics
,
collecting
beer
caps
—
that
each
appeared
obscure
to
anyone
else
.

DIY
Dentistry
was
just
something
that
had
never
crossed
our
horizon
before
.

And
if
Steven
did
n’t
see
it
as
weird
,
or
no
weirder
than
Andy
showing
us
his
Eastern-Block
beer
caps
all
laid
out
neatly
on
cork
boards
with
little
hand-written
labels
,
why
should
it
bother
us
?

I
suppose
that
,
in
our
own
way
,
we
were
all
collectively
strange
.

The
bunch
that
no
one
picked
for
their
side
at
football
or
hockey
,
and
that
was
the
glue
that
held
us
together
.

Besides
,
Steven
had
some
really
good
stuff
:
sweets
that
stained
your
teeth
bright
red
—
well
,
technically
,
not
your
teeth
,
just
the
plaque
,
but
the
result
was
often
the
same
.

It
took
a
few
days
good
brushing
to
get
it
off
.

Well
,
most
of
it
anyway
.

He
had
effervescent
tablets
that
turned
the
canteen
drinking
water
into
that
exact
same
pink
mixture
that
the
dentist
gave
you
to
rinse
your
mouth
out
after
scraping
around
inside
,
and
guaranteed
to
make
the
other
kids
splutter
and
spit
it
out
when
the
taste
slowly
percolated
through
and
met
the
memory
of
their
last
checkup
.

Then
there
was
the
event
that
became
the
rite
of
passage
into
our
group
of
misfits
and
outcasts
:
making
a
mould
of
your
teeth
.

It
was
inevitable
that
one
of
us
,
seeing
the
plaster
casts
on
the
shelf
by
Steven
’s
bed
would
ask
how
they
were
done
.

It
was
just
as
inevitable
that
a
few
minutes
later
,
Steven
would
be
mixing
up
various
powders
and
liquids
,
and
pouring
them
into
a
horse-shoe
shaped
contraption
.

It
was
n’t
dangerous
.

At
least
,
I
suppose
so
.

It
was
vaguely
uncomfortable
,
and
appeared
sufficiently
disturbing
that
we
all
volunteered
each
other
in
turn
until
,
at
last
,
Andy
said
he
was
game
.

And
we
were
off
.

The
hardest
part
was
probably
to
overcome
the
gagging
reflex
that
set
in
when
you
bit
down
into
the
acrid
resin
jelly
and
it
flowed
out
and
up
and
around
,
over
teeth
,
gums
and
tongue
.

Your
nose
filled
with
what
you
imagined
were
fumes
from
the
warm
paste
.

And
you
seemed
to
be
suddenly
drowning
in
your
own
saliva
.

Things
generally
got
better
when
Steven
reminded
you
that
you
could
actually
breathe
,
and
swallow
,
normally
.

He
watched
the
second
hand
trotting
round
the
dial
of
his
watch
mouthing
the
quarters
,
before
poking
the
setting
goo
to
check
its
consistency
.

Then
,
when
he
gave
you
the
nod
,
you
tried
to
prise
your
jaws
apart
.

As
the
seal
around
your
gums
and
teeth
was
pretty
solid
,
you
thought
it
would
never
come
off
,
as
the
others
giggled
at
your
expressions
and
grimaces
.

Steven
jiggled
the
handle
that
stuck
out
beyond
your
front
teeth
like
some
metallic
duck
’s
bill
,
turning
and
twisting
it
most
professionally
and
murmuring
encouragements
.

And
,
then
,
with
an
awful
sucking
slurp
,
it
came
free
.

The
initiated
then
revelled
in
retelling
the
gross
sensation
of
having
this
evil-smelling
plastic
slug
invade
your
mouth
,
while
the
others
waited
their
turn
with
mixed
trepidation
and
excitement
.

Raucous
laughter
greeted
the
suggestions
of
the
other
body
parts
that
could
receive
the
same
treatment
.

The
next
part
of
the
proceedings
was
less
thrilling
.

Steven
measured
and
mixed
the
plaster
of
Paris
and
prepared
for
the
cast
by
using
a
bright
blue
putty
to
build
up
the
form
of
the
jaw
,
and
shoring
up
gaps
and
holes
.

It
get
even
less
exciting
when
he
said
we
’d
have
to
wait
an
hour
while
the
plaster
set
real
solid
.

But
the
next
time
we
visited
his
room
we
got
to
marvel
at
our
toothy
grins
labelled
and
lined
up
on
the
shelf
.

We
were
all
perfectly
happy
with
the
result
,
even
wanting
one
as
a
trophy
until
Steven
passed
an
expert
eye
over
them
,
pointing
out
here
a
gap
,
here
a
filling
,
and
there
a
completely
misaligned
incisor
.

We
were
,
he
told
us
,
mediocre
specimens
for
his
collection
.

It
did
n’t
matter
.

We
were
all
friends
,
a
group
bonded
by
the
common
experience
of
being
able
to
see
our
teeth
on
Steven
’s
shelf
.

Christopher
Hill
,
U.S.
Republican
Party
presidential
candidate

Interview

What
qualifications
do
you
have
that
will
assist
you
in
executing
the
duties
of
president
?

My
Presidential
qualifications
are
rooted
in
my
service
as
an
Officer
in
the
United
States
Air
Force
.

I
took
the
Oath
to
our
Constitution
at
22
years
old
.

I
understood
it
was
an
Oath
to
ALL
of
our
people
.

Politicians
profess
an
Oath
to
this
nation
but
once
in
office
pursue
their
party
agenda
and
reward
their
voters
.

As
President
,
I
will
serve
ALL
of
the
people
in
America
,
guided
by
the
Constitution
.

Why
run
for
president
?

Why
not
run
for
a
lower
office
that
you
would
be
more
likely
to
win
and
effect
change
?

When
I
was
a
young
man
in
Air
Force
ROTC
I
was
chosen
to
attend
a
unique
Pilot
Training
Program
called
Euro-
NATO
Joint
Jet
Pilot
Training
.

The
Air
Force
only
selected
180
Officers
a
year
from
the
Academy
,
Squadron
Officer
School
and
ROTC
to
attend
.

I
volunteered
for
that
program
because
I
knew
I
wanted
to
be
a
Fighter
Pilot
and
at
the
"
Top
of
the
Spear
.
"

In
those
days
it
was
all
or
nothing
.

If
you
graduated
you
were
assigned
a
fighter
,
if
you
were
not
quite
fighter
pilot
material
you
had
no
response
to
fly
another
aircraft
,
you
were
washed
out
.

Congress
has
proven
itself
ineffective
as
a
body
.

To
make
a
difference
in
America
you
must
have
the
"
Bully
Pulpit
"
and
speak
to
the
People
.

The
President
has
that
pulpit
.

All
or
nothing
.

I
never
wanted
to
make
politics
a
career
.

Why
did
you
choose
to
run
in
the
Republican
Party
?

My
ties
to
the
Republican
party
date
back
to
1979
,
when
I
volunteered
for
Ronald
Reagan
and
his
campaign
in
New
Hampshire
.

In
those
days
I
believed
there
was
a
difference
in
the
parties
.

Today
,
like
many
Americans
,
I
am
skeptical
.

I
understand
third
party
candidates
have
no
success
.

I
hope
to
lead
the
Republican
party
in
a
new
direction
for
working
class
Americans
.

How
do
you
plan
to
get
into
the
Republican
debates
and
make
an
impact
on
polls
?

In
order
to
be
invited
to
the
debates
,
we
must
raise
money
and
poll
nationally
.

This
is
an
effort
that
is
underway
.

Recently
we
were
listed
in
New
Hampshire
and
nationally
with
Politics1
.

If
you
do
not
receive
the
Republican
nomination
,
would
you
consider
running
as
a
third
party
candidate
?

No
,
I
will
back
the
nominee
of
the
Republican
party
in
2016
.

After
that
,
I
may
reconsider
.

Other
than
yourself
,
which
candidates
have
you
supported
for
president
in
previous
campaigns
?

Reagan
in
80
and
84
,
[
George
H.
W.
]
Bush
in
88
and
92
,
[
Phil
]
Gramm
in
96
,
[
George
W.
]
Bush
in
2000
and
,
Romney
in
08
.

What
are
your
thoughts
on
the
job
Barack
Obama
has
done
as
president
?

Specifically
,
what
would
you
have
done
differently
?

President
Obama
has
an
agenda
that
represents
the
far
left
wing
of
his
party
.

His
use
of
the
Presidency
to
further
this
agenda
has
in
many
ways
been
unconstitutional
.

Specifically
,
altering
law
once
it
is
passed
to
accommodate
his
voting
blocs
.

His
direction
to
Eric
Holder
to
enforce
some
laws
and
not
others
is
another
example
.

Hill
at
the
Lesser-known
candidates
forum
in
2011

If
elected
,
what
would
constitute
a
successful
presidency
for
you
?

Achieving
four
goals
:

Term
Limits
for
Congress
and
the
Courts
returning
government
to
the
People
.

Implementing
a
Tax
System
that
allows
working
Americans
making
under
$
250,000
to
keep
all
of
their
money
.

Closing
Loopholes
and
putting
in
place
a
system
that
is
transparent
and
works
.

Passing
a
Living
Wage
program
lifting
people
out
of
poverty
.

Returning
America
to
a
state
of
Peace
and
Security
.

What
individuals
would
you
like
to
see
in
a
Hill
administration
?

I
would
like
to
bring
People
from
the
heartland
of
America
that
make
this
nation
work
.

We
have
had
too
many
decades
of
Ivy
League
elites
and
Professors
immersed
in
theory
.

Hill
(
right
)
with
fellow
2012
presidential
candidate
Buddy
Roemer
.

Anything
else
you
would
like
to
add
?

A
final
thought
.

America
is
a
nation
that
will
endure
.

I
believe
it
is
our
responsibility
to
pass
on
the
same
opportunities
to
future
generations
that
were
promised
to
us
.

As
President
,
I
intend
to
keep
that
promise
!

Wikinews

Robert
Sarvis
,
Libertarian
Party
nominee
for
Governor
of
Virginia

Saturday

,
2013

Attorney
Robert
Sarvis
,
the
Libertarian
Party
's
nominee
for
Governor
of
Virginia
,
answered
five
questions
submitted
via
e-mail
by
accredited
Wikinews
reporter
William
Saturn
.

Sarvis
has
garnered
double
digits
in
opinion
polls
for
the
2013
Virginia
gubernatorial
election
,
an
unusual
feat
for
a
third
party
candidate
.

The
latest
Newsmax
/
Zogby
poll
from
late
September
placed
him
at
13
percent
,
14
points
behind
Republican
Party
nominee
Ken
Cuccinelli
,
Virginia
's
Attorney
General
,
and
19
points
behind
Democratic
Party
nominee
Terry
McAuliffe
,
the
former
Democratic
National
Committee
chairman
,
with
24
percent
undecided
.

Whoever
wins
election
on
November
5
,
2013
,
would
replace
outgoing
governor
Bob
McDonnell
.

On
his
campaign
website
,
Sarvis
notes
he
favors
parental
school
choice
through
student
vouchers
,
simplification
of
Virginia
's
Tax
Code
,
US
Second
Amendment
-
gun
-

,
and
reform
of

Sarvis
discusses
his

on
McDonnell
's
tenure
,
keys
to
campaign
success
,
plan
to
implement
his

,
and
the
former
Virginia
governor
he
most
admires
.

Interview

What
is
the
most
important
aspect
of
your
background
that
voters
should
know
about
?

I
am
the
only
candidate
born
and
raised
in
Virginia
,
but
also
the
only
candidate
who
embodies
both
physically
and
philosophically
the
growing
diversity
of
the
commonwealth
.

(
I
am
mixed-race
(
half-Chinese
)
and
in
an
interracial
marriage
.
)

I
am
the
only
candidate
who
has
studied
both
economics
and
law
,
and
the
only
candidate
with
a
background
in
technology
entrepreneurship
.

Because
of
my
academic
and
professional
background
,
I
understand
the
issues
and
challenges
facing
Virginia
much
better
than
the
other
candidates
,
and
I
am
offering
real
solutions
that
can
be
appreciated
across
the
political
spectrum
.

I
am
the
only
candidate
who
believes
in
both
economic
freedom
and
personal
liberty
and
the
only
candidate
who
stands
on
principle
against
cronyism
and
corporatism
and
in
favor
of
the
rule
of
law
.

What
are
your
thoughts
on
the
job
Bob
McDonnell
has
done
as
Governor
of
Virginia
?

What
would
you
have
done
differently
than
him
?

McDonnell
did
well
early
in
his
term
pushing
back
against
Senate
Democrats
who
wanted
huge
tax
increases
in
response
to
major
revenue
shortfalls
during
the
recession
.

Those
early
budget
efforts
are
his
highest
achievements
as
Governor
.

More
recently
,
he
erred
in
accepting
a
transportation
bill
that
had
huge
flaws
and
huge
tax
increases
,
rather
than
prioritizing
spending
and
seeking
more
rational
,
efficient
,
decentralized
transportation
decision-making
.

He
could
have
shown
much
greater
leadership
in
pushing
for
tax
reform
,
regulatory
reform
,
and
school
choice
.

Of
course
,
he
showed
ethical
lapses
in
judgment
.

Compared
to
previous
third
party
candidates
at
the
gubernatorial
level
,
you
have
done
exceptionally
well
in
opinion
polling
.

What
do
you
attribute
that
success
to
?

Voters
see
the
two-party
system
for
the
sham
it
has
become
.

They
are
sick
of
the
partisanship
and
nonsense
and
the
total
lack
of
substance
in
modern
campaigns
.

Voters
see
the
two
major
party
nominees
as
exemplifying
what
is
worst
about
their
respective
parties
,
and
they
want
something
better
.

Voters
who
meet
me
and
hear
me
speak
know
that
I
am
sincere
,
know
that
I
understand
the
issues
deeply
and
have
workable
solutions
,
and
know
that
I
stand
on
principle
against
cronyism
and
corporatism
and
in
favor
of
the
rule
of
law
and
the
public
interest
.

People
like
the
fact
that
I
stand
for
a
Virginia
that
is
both
Open-minded
and
Open
for
Business
.

If
elected
governor
,
how
will
you
be
able
to
implement
your
agenda
while
dealing
with
a
hostile
legislature
?

There
are
precedents
of
independent
governors
dealing
effectively
with
the
legislature
,
and
indeed
a
wise
third-party
governor
can
have
greater
effectiveness
than
a
major
party
governor
.

Libertarians
share
many
policy
positions
with
each
of
the
major
parties
.

Working
together
with
both
Republicans
and
Democrats
,
we
can
get
the
good
aspects
of
each
party
while
rejecting
the
bad
parts
of
both
.

Moreover
,
electing
a
third-party
governor
represents
a
repudiation
of
politics
as
usual
,
and
the
major
party
legislators
will
face
changed
constraints
and
incentives
,
meaning
that
much
more
is
possible
than
many
people
assume
,
especially
with
strong
leadership
.

Which
previous
Virginia
Governor(s)
do
you
most
admire
and
why
?

Thomas
Jefferson
.

He
was
incredibly
learned
and
was
a
strong
advocate
for
freedom
and
the
rule
of
law
.

He
would
be
a
Libertarian
today
.

Interview
with
LibriVox
founder
Hugh
McGuire

Sunday
,
May
28
,
2006

The
LibriVox
website
features
a
catalog
of
about
a
hundred
completed
books
,
including
books
in
other
languages
like
German
,
Hebrew
,
and
Japanese
.

Why
did
you
decide
to
take
the
acoustic
fate
of
public
domain
works
into
your
own
hands
,
and
how
did
you
go
about
it
?

I
think
that
a
vibrant
public
domain
is
very
important
to
a
healthy
world
,
and
so
I
thought
:
here
's
a
way
to
help
the
cause
.

I
launched
LibriVox
,
emailed
some
friends
and
some
podcasters
who
where
doing
literary
stuff
,
and
invited
them
to
record
a
chapter
of
Joseph
Conrad
's
Secret
Agent
.

Things
have
grown
steadily
since
.

By
the
way
,
AKMA
was
the
first
guy
I
know
of
to
do
something
like
this
,
with
Lawrence
Lessig
's
Free
Culture
.

That
,
I
think
,
started
my
thinking
about
this
,
but
it
took
a
while
for
the
idea
to
crystallize
.

Hugh
McGuire
with
some
books
that
have
not
yet
been
acoustically
liberated
.

Do
you
personally
record
audiobooks
,
and
did
you
already
do
so
before
LibriVox
?

LibriVox
was
my
first
experience
recording
audiobooks
.

I
still
do
the
odd
chapter
,
but
i
am
a
bit
delinquent
in
finishing
some
of
them
these
days
!

Is
there
a
particular
LibriVox
book
which
you
think
stands
out
because
of
the
quality
,
the
overall
effort
involved
,
its
popularity
,
or
for
some
other
reason
?

My
personal
favourite
is
Notes
from
the
Underground
(
Dostoyevsky
)
.

Other
random
good
ones
:

Austen
,
Jane
.

Pride
and
Prejudice

Christie
,
Agatha
.

The
Mysterious
Affair
at
Styles

London
,
Jack
.

White
Fang

Macaulay
,
Thomas
Babington
.

History
of
England
(
Volume
1
,
Chapter
1
)

Marx
,
Karl
and
Engels
,
Friedrich
.

The
Communist
Manifesto
(
solo
)

Twain
,
Mark
.

A
Connecticut
Yankee
in
King
Arthur
's
Court
(
solo
)

Ed.
:
See
the
LibriVox
catalog
for
a
full
index
.

Browsing
the
catalog
,
I
find
that
the
quality
of
the
spoken
audio
varies
greatly
from
text
to
text
or
even
from
chapter
to
chapter
.

If
someone
wanted
to
re-record
a
chapter
because
they
did
n't
like
the
speaker
,
would
you
then
offer
two
versions
?

Yes
.

We
take
the
Wikipedia
approach
:
if
you
think
it
should
be
better
,
please
help
it
be
so
.

You
'll
note
we
offer
a
couple
of
versions
of
some
books
.

Indeed
our
weekly
poetry
project
celebrates
this
diversity
of
voice
:
each
week
a
new
short
poem
is
chosen
and
as
many
readers
as
wish
to
record
a
version
,
so
you
get
20
+
versions
of
the
same
poem
,
a
very
interesting
audio
experience
.

Besides
works
whose
copyright
has
expired
,
there
is
an
increasing
number
of
modern
books
available
under
Creative
Commons
and
similar
licenses
.

You
mentioned
Larry
Lessig
's
Free
Culture
,
but
it
also
includes
some
out
of
print
titles
by
publishers
who
are
open
to
the
concept
,
such
as
O'Reilly
.

Do
you
want
to
limit
the
scope
of
LibriVox
strictly
to
old
public
domain
works
,
or
do
you
have
plans
to
include
recent
works
under
reasonably
permissive
licenses
as
well
?

We
are
only
doing
public
domain
works
,
for
a
number
of
reasons
,
partly
to
keep
simplicity
in
our
copyright
situation
--
public
domain
means
it
s
as
simple
as
can
be
.

CC
makes
things
more
complex
.

Also
,
there
are
other
sites
,
notably
podiobooks.com
,
which
are
better
suited
to
CC
works
than
LibriVox
.

we
find
it
makes
things
clear
and
easy
to
say
:
published
works
,
public
domain
,
and
leave
it
at
that
.

As
far
as
I
can
tell
,
podiobooks.com
features
"
free
as
in
beer
"
content
—
material
which
you
can
download
,
but
which
is
n't
under
a
free
content
license
.

Instead
of
"
public
domain
"
,
would
n't
"
free
content
"
work
just
as
well
,
using
something
like
the
Free
Content
Definition
to
limit
the
scope
?

This
needs
more
discussion
obviously
:
we
chose
public
domain
because
the
texts
we
use
are
public
domain
and
we
did
n't
want
to
add
new
restrictions
,
especially
not
non-commercial
,
since
already
our
recordings
are
being
used
for
a
number
of
commercialish
projects
(
I
ca
n't
recall
any
specific
project
names
,
but
some
pay-education
sites
use
LV
stuff
)
.

That
's
good
and
well
and
fine
with
us
.

We
do
n't
want
to
have
to
give
anyone
permission
to
use
our
recordings
,
we
want
anyone
to
use
them
for
whatever
they
want
.

Also
,
for
the
thing
to
work
you
need
to
have
many
dedicated
volunteers
willing
to
do
the
management
(
onerous
)
and
many
willing
to
do
the
reading
.

While
Pride
and
Prejudice
will
attract
many
readers
,
I
do
n't
know
about
O'Reilly
's
latest
tome
on
XML
...
though
I
might
be
wrong
.

Fan
Expo
Canada
took
place
at
the
Metro
Toronto
Convention
Centre
this
weekend
,
attracting
thousands
to
the
event
,
one
of
the
most
popular
in
North
America
.

Crossing
between
the
genres
of
science
fiction
,
horror
,
anime
,
fantasy
and
comics
,
the
event
sprawled
throughout
all
corners
of
the
facility
.

Hundreds
of
vendors
offered
products
new
and
old
,
joined
by
celebrity
guests
like
Stan
Lee
,
Mark
Hamill
,
and
Margaret
Atwood
.

Various
local
fan
organizations
were
there
in
a
charitable
capacity
,
and
thousands
of
fans
donned
costumes
,
many
of
which
they
themselves
created
.

Atwood
,
a
Booker
Prize-winner
,
was
there
to
launch
her
graphic
novel
Angel
Catbird
,
with
illustrator
Johnnie
Christmas
.

Lee
was
making
his
final
Canadian
convention
appearance
,
part
of
a
larger
farewell
tour
.

Hamill
's
schedule
included
a
panel
with
Kevin
Conroy
,
the
voice
of
Batman
in
Batman
:
The
Animated
Series
,
in
which
the
Star
Wars

played
the
Joker
.

Ubisoft
,
Microsoft
,
and
PlayStation
VR
all
had
large
areas
set
up
for
attendees
to
try
their
latest
games
.

In
the
20-minute
PlayStation
VR
demonstration
of
Batman
:
Arkham
VR
,
players
are
dropped
down
a
secret
elevator
in
Bruce
Wayne
's
manor
,
to
the
Bat
Cave
,
to
suit
up
.

From
there
,
the
demonstration
took
players
to
investigate
the
murder
of
Nightwing
.

The
Northern
Arena
Esports
Championship
ran
throughout
the
weekend
,
facing
off
teams
of
video
gamers
in
a
packed
hall
.

Even
in
early
rounds
,
the
event
was
well
attended
,
with
the
stands
full
of
gamers
,
watching
the
matches
with
live
colour
commentary
.

The
finals
saw
US
team
Cloud9
and
Immortals
,
from
Brazil
,
face
off
in
Counter-Strike

Global
Offensive
.

Both
unbeaten
teams
going
in
,
the
Brazillian
team
won
the
championship
and
$
50,000
.

Gameplay
was
delayed
during
the
"
third
map
"
(
third
round
)
of
the
finals
,
when
one
Immortals
player
was
caught
with
their
headset
off
.

After
nearly
half
an
hour
,
the
team
was
deducted
a
point
,
leading
to
a
sudden
but
temporary
rush
of
success
by
the
US
team
.

The
thousands
of
cosplay
outfits
on
parade
around
the
various
halls
offered
a
tremendous
cross-section
of
genres
and
eras
of
pop
culture
.

The
majority
of
outfits
involved
at
least
some
elements
made
from
scratch
,
a
fantastic
display
of
craftsmanship
.

Of
the
thousands
,
Wikinews
spoke
with
a
cosplayer
going
by
the
name
"
The
Katherinator
"
.

She
was
outside
the

in
the
gardens
,
waiting
for
a
photographer
she
had
arranged
to
shoot
her
new
Epic
Mickey
costumed
character-style
outfit
.

With
shoes
as
wide
as
a
forearm
,
and
a
rigid
torso
of
carved
foam
,
she
remained
exuberant
even
when
caught
in
the
traffic
between
halls
,
many
hours
into
wearing
the
outfit
.

will
be
permanently
displayed
at
the
conclusion
of
the
Space
Shuttle
Program
during

NASA
celebrated
the
launch
of
the
first
space
shuttle
Tuesday
at
an
event
at
the
Kennedy
Space
Center
(
KSC
)
in
Cape
Canaveral
,
Florida
.

On
April
12
,
1981
,
Space
Shuttle
Columbia
lifted
off
from
the
Kennedy
Space
Center
on
STS-1
,
the
first
space
shuttle
mission
.

NASA
held
a
ceremony
commemorating
the
date
outside
the
hangar
,
known
as
Orbiter
Processing
Facility-1
,
for
Space
Shuttle
Atlantis
,
which
is
being
prepped
for
its
final
mission
which
will
be
STS-135
,
which
will
be
the
last
Space
Shuttle
mission
.

At
the
ceremony
,
NASA
Administrator
Charles
Bolden
announced
the
locations
that
would
be
given
the
three
remaining
Space
Shuttle
orbiters
following
the
end
of
the
Space
Shuttle
program
.

The
prototype
orbiter
,
Space
Shuttle
Enterprise
would
be
relocated
from
the
Smithsonian
's
National
Air
and
Space
Museum
Steven
F.
Udvar-Hazy
Center
at
Washington
Dulles
International
Airport
to
the
Intrepid
Sea-Air-Space
Museum
in
New
York
City
.

Space
Shuttle
Discovery
will
take
the
place
of
Enterprise
at
the
Udvar-Hazy
Center
.

Discovery
has
already
been
retired
following
the
completion
of
STS-133
last
month
,
its
39th
mission
.

Discovery
is
undergoing
decommissioning
and
currently
being
prepped
for
display
by
removing
toxic
materials
from
the
orbiter
.

Looking
back
:

off
on

from
Launch
Pad

at
the
Kennedy

Center
on

.

Space
Shuttle
Endeavour
,
which
will
launch
on
STS-134
at
the
end
of
the
month
on
April
29
,
will
be
sent
to
the
California
Science
Center
in
Los
Angeles
,
California
following
its
retirement
.

Finally
,
Atlantis
will
go
on
display
at
the
Kennedy
Space
Center
Visitor
Complex
following
the
orbiter
's
last
flight
which
launches
June
28
.

Columbia
was
lost
tragically
back
on
February
1
,
2003
when
it
disintegrated
during
re-entry
killing
all
seven
astronauts
aboard
.

Space
Shuttle
Challenger
was
lost
when
it
exploded
73
seconds
after
liftoff
back
on
January
28
,
1986
killing
all
six
aboard
.

"
We
want
to
thank
all
of
the
locations
that
expressed
an
interest
in
one
of
these
national
treasures
,
"
said
Bolden
to
the
gathered
crowd
which
contained
many
KSC
employees
.

"
This
was
a
very
difficult
decision
,
but
one
that
was
made
with
the
American
public
in
mind
.

In
the
end
,
these
choices
provide
the
greatest
number
of
people
with
the
best
opportunity
to
share
in
the
history
and
accomplishments
of
NASA
's
remarkable
Space
Shuttle
Program
.

These
facilities
we
've
chosen
have
a
noteworthy
legacy
of
preserving
space
artifacts
and
providing
outstanding
access
to
U.S.
and
international
visitors
.
"

This

Not
all
were
pleased
with
the
final
choice
of
locations
.

U.S.
Senator
John
Cornyn
,
Republican
from
Texas
,
issued
a
statement
regarding
the
rejection
of
Johnson
Space
Center
(
JSC
)
in
Houston
,
Texas
as
a
location
.

"
Like
many
Texans
,
I
am
disappointed
with
NASA
's
decision
to
slight
the
Johnson
Space
Center
as
a
permanent
home
for
one
of
the
Space
Shuttle
Orbiters
.

Houston
has
played
a
critical
role
throughout
the
life
of
the
space
shuttle
,
but
it
is
clear
political
favors
trumped
common
sense
and
fairness
in
the
selection
of
the
final
locations
for
the
orbiter
fleet
.
"

Cornyn
's
statement
added
,
"
There
is
no
question
Houston
should
have
been
selected
as
a
final
home
for
one
of
the
orbiters
—
even
Administrator
Bolden
stated
as
much
.

Today
's
announcement
is
an
affront
to
the
thousands
of
dedicated
men
and
women
at
Johnson
Space
Center
,
the
greater
Houston
community
and
the
State
of
Texas
,
and
I
m
deeply
disappointed
with
the
Administration
's
misguided
decision
.
“

However
,
the
JSC
will
recieve
pilot
and
commander
seats
from
the
flight
deck
.

The
Museum
of
Flight
in
Seattle
,
Washington
was
also
proposed
as
another
location
for
a
shuttle
,
going
so
far
as
to
build
a
new
building
to
house
an
orbiter
.

In
a
statement
,
Governor
of
Washington
Chris
Gregoire
said
,
"
The
Museum
of
Flight
put
a
tremendous
amount
of
effort
into
landing
a
retired
shuttle
in
the
Pacific
Northwest
.

As
the
home
of
modern
day
air
travel
and
the
747
,
which
has
gracefully
transported
shuttles
for
the
last
30
years
,
Seattle
would
have
been
a
perfect
fit
.

While
the
Museum
of
Flight
was
in
the
top
running
,
I
m
disappointed
that
NASA
did
not
choose
them
.

In
2008
,
Endeavour
and
Atlantis
await
a
journey
on
their
respective
launchpads
.

"
However
,
the
full
fuselage
trainer
,
that
every
astronaut
including
[
former
Museum
of
Flight
CEO
]
Bonnie
Dunbar
has
been
trained
on
,
will
soon
call
the
Museum
of
Flight
home
.

The
largest
of
the
trainers
,
this
addition
will
allow
visitors
to
actually
climb
aboard
the
trainer
and
experience
the
hands-on
training
that
astronauts
get
.

Visitors
will
not
be
allowed
in
the
other
shuttles
and
this
trainer
is
a
true
win
for
our
dynamic
museum
.

It
will
help
inspire
young
people
to
the
adventure
of
space
and
to
the
excitement
of
a
career
in
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
math
.

Sensitive
Canadian
document
found
on
rainy
streets

Friday
,
August
15
,
2008

A
sensitive
Environment
Canada
document
was
found
wet
on
an
Ottawa
street
by
someone
who
gave
it
to
the
CBC
today
.

The
131-page
document
was
found
on
Castlefrank
Road
in
Kanata
,
Ontario
in
a
rain-stained
,
tire-marked
brown
envelope
by
a
passerby
.

The
document
which
had
the
stamp
Protected
B
on
every
page
detailed
various
security
vulnerabilities
of
the
NEMISIS
database
which
is
used
by
officers
to
track
and
prosecute
environmental
law-breakers
.

If
someone
were
able
to
shut
the
system
down
,
or
hack
inside
and
delete
or
corrupt
the
information
,
it
could
affect
the
prosecution
of
the
lawbreakers
.

The
database
was
unveiled
in
1999
as
the
National
Enforcement
Management
Information
System
and
Intelligence
System
.

However
,
on
the
document
,
it
referred
to
the
database
as
National
Enforcement
and
Emergency
Management
Information
System
and
Intelligence
System
,
adding
the
words
"
and
Emergency
"
to
the
name
.

Protection
B
documents
are
the
second
lowest
grade
of
classified
government
documents
.

Environment
Canada
spokesperson
Julie
Hahn
said
they
apply
to
letters
of
complaint
,
criticism
or
injury
,
research
or
scientific
notes
and
findings
that
do
n`t
have
any
conclusion
,
and
Treasury
Board
letters
,
agendas
and
minutes
that
do
n`t
deal
with
subjects
of
national
interest
.

Environment
Minister
John
Baird
has
asked
government
officials
how
such
documents
that
are
supposed
to
be
stored
in
"
approved
security
cabinets
"
wound
up
on
the
street
.

"
I
'm
told
two
things
:
that
it
's
neither
classified
nor
secret
and
that
it
's
stuff
that
could
be
available
under
access
to
information
,
"
Baird
said
.

Environment
Canada
spokeswoman
Sujata
Raisinghani
told
CBC
News
the
department
will
look
into
the
incident
.

"
We
take
document
security
seriously
,
"
she
said
,
but
refused
to
give
any
more
details
about
how
the
papers
came
to
be
on
a
road
.

Paul
Dewar
,
an
Ottawa
New
Democrat
MP
,
said
the
combined
security
lapses
raise
serious
questions
about
the
government
's
ability
to
secure
sensitive
documents
.

Dewar
says
that
bureaucrats
of
the
Conservative
government
have
complained
to
him
about
document
security
to
the
point
that
they
ca
n`t
share
the
information
with
their
own
colleagues
.

However
,
when
a
government
document
has
been
found
on
the
streets
,
the
government
then
says
it
was
n't
particularly
sensitive
.

"
This
government
is
so
consumed
with
control
of
information
and
secrecy
yet
they
do
n't
seem
to
be
able
to
get
the
fundamentals
right
,
"
Dewar
said
.

The
incident
is
a
reminiscent
of
two
other
incidents
.

In
March
,
a
bundle
of
blueprints
for
a
new
headquarters
for
the
military
's
counterterrorism
unit
were
found
stuffed
in
the
trash
on
a
downtown
street
.

In
May
,
Maxime
Bernier
was
forced
to
resign
as
Foreign
Affairs
minister
after
it
became
known
that
he
left
sensitive
documents
at
the
apartment
of
his
then-girlfriend
Julie
Couillard
who
had
ties
to
the
Hells
Angels
biker
gang
.

Francisco
,
its
larger
neighbor
lying
directly
to
the
west
,
Oakland
has
in
recent
years
began
to
step
out
from
under
the
shadows
,
playing
upon
the
beautiful
highlights
of
its
own
and
its
rise
as
the
multicultural
"
hipster
'
city
of
the
Bay
Area
.

Since
the
1960s
,
Oakland
has
been
a
hub
of
radical
culture
,
and
is
the
birthplace
of
both
the
Black
Panther
Party
and
the
Hell
's
Angels
.

Oakland
's
history
in
the
arts
and
entertainment
arena
is
notable
as
well
,
as
Oakland
has
nurtured
or
been
a
second
home
to
novelists
Gertrude
Stein
,
Jack
London
,
Amy
Tan
,
and
Maya
Angelou
;
actors
Meryl
Streep
,
Mark
Hamill
,
Bruce
Lee
,
and
Tom
Hanks
;
architect
Julia
"
Butterfly
"
Hill
;
classical
conductor
Calvin
Simmons
;
rappers
MC
Hammer
,
2Pac
,
Messy
Marv
,
and
several
other
notables
in
the
liberal
arts
and
sciences
.

Oakland
as
a
city
reflects
the
amazing
diversity
of
its
residents
and
long
history
.

For
many
visitors
,
the
first
place
they
are
likely
to
visit
is
Downtown
,
especially
if
they
are
in
town
on
business
,
or
simply
do
not
know
where
to
start
.

The
center
of
transportation
by
BART
and
by
bus
is
there
,
if
one
wants
to
branch
out
.

And
it
is
as
simple
as
walking
in
a
direction
from
there
,
for
the
first
few
neighborhoods
,
since
Old
Oakland
is
along
10th
Street
,
just
west
of
Broadway
.

Just
east
of
Broadway
and
continuing
north
and
south
is
Oakland
's
famous
Chinatown
,
and
that
to
get
the
real
essence
of
"
Chinatown
,
"
Oakland
rather
than
San
Francisco
is
your
best
bet
.

Many
of
the
buildings
and
streets
of
Chinatown
reflect
the
diverse
nature
of
its
history
,
in
architecture
and
in
the
bilingual
signs
seen
throughout
the
neighborhood
.

The
curious
traveler
can
venture
to
take
a
bus
southwards
along
Broadway
,
and
come
to
Jack
London
Square
.

The
unlikely
mixture
of
warehouses
and
very
expensive
restaurants
and
posh
atmosphere
alongside
some
of
the
landmarks
of
the
city
's
waterfront
makes
the
Square
an
interesting
place
to
visit
and
explore
,
even
for
locals
.

It
's
the
home
of
the
USS
Potomac
and
the
site
of
the
namesake
author
's
residence
,
still
preserved
and
humbly
standing
not
far
from
a
saloon
from
the
same
era
.

Just
west
of
Downtown
and
slightly
north
of
the
Financial
District
is
Uptown
.

In
the
evening
it
buzzes
with
art
galleries
,
theaters
and
residents
and
Bay
Area
visitors
coming
into
the
area
to
see
concerts
.

A
popular
area
on
the
weekend
with
a
mixed
vibe
of
hipster
and
hip
hop
.

It
's
a
burgeoning
neighborhood
of
performing
arts
ranging
from
nightclubs
to
music
halls
,
avant-garde
performance
art
,
and
even
an
improv
theater
company
.

Uptown
also
has
some
of
the
best
in
the
city
's
vintage
architecture
,
like
the
Gothic
Revival
Cathedral
Building
and
the
Art
Deco
Fox
and
Paramount
Theaters
,
as
well
as
several
restaurants
.

North
Oakland
is
a
sweeping
term
,
referring
to
just
about
everywhere
north
of
Uptown
and
Lake
Merritt
.

Many
of
the
neighborhoods
are
commercial
centers
and
absolute
heaven
for
foodies
or
those
who
seek
quieter
surroundings
than
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
Downtown
and
Chinatown
.

Temescal
is
a
neighborhood
that
lies
north-northwest
from
Downtown
,
centered
along
the
reach
of
Telegraph
Avenue
,
at
and
near
51st
Street
.

Until
the
1960s
,
a
dominantly
Italian-American
neighborhood
,
it
is
now
a
much
more
diversified
neighborhood
,
home
to
many
restaurants
,
including
some
of
the
city
's
best
Korean
and
Ethiopian
establishments
.

Northeast
of
Temescal
and
near
the
Berkeley
border
lies
Rockridge
,
a
neighborhood
mixed
with
family
friendly
and
artistic
vibes
.

It
has
lots
of
local
boutiques
and
a
diverse
range
of
food
at
all
prices
and
styles
.

Open-air
markets
,
bookstores
,
and
a
BART
station
all
its
own
make
Rockridge
another
of
many
pleasant
stops
in
North
Oakland
.

South
of
Rockridge
,
and
southeast
of
Temescal
lies
Piedmont
Avenue
,
a
street
extending
from
Broadway
near
34th
and
Hawthorne
and
an
area
with
a
group
of
hospitals
on
a
hill
(
Pill
Hill
)
up
and
through
a
neighborhood
bordered
on
both
sides
by
picturesque
hills
,
houses
and
trees
.

Another
of
North
Oakland
's
group
of
foodie
spots
,
home
to
the
city
's
single
Michelin-rated
restaurant
and
many
others
;
cafes
,
ice
cream
,
coffee
shops
and
pleasant
walks
complete
the
vision
of
this
interesting
and
quiet
neighborhood
.

East
along
I-580
and
not
far
from
Piedmont
Avenue
are
two
neighborhoods
separated
by
a
couple
of
blocks
.

Grand
Lake
and
Lakeshore
both
share
a
friendly
,
suburban
sort
of
feel
.

The
Grand
Lake
Theater
stands
at
the
entrance
to
the
neighborhood
that
bears
its
name
,
a
matter
of
a
few
hundred
feet
from
Lakeshore
Avenue
–
both
are
diverse
neighborhoods
no
matter
what
your
budget
,
be
it
burgers
or
sandwiches
or
a
full
romantic
evening
,
either
of
these
twin-sister
neighborhoods
will
make
a
pleasant
time
,
by
day
or
night
.

West
Oakland
was
once
a
burgeoning
working-class
neighborhood
with
its
roots
tracing
as
far
back
as
the
opening
decades
of
the
19th
century
.

It
has
seen
a
period
of
decline
between
the
1960s
and
the
more
recent
past
.

Strangely
,
twice
in
its
history
the
neighborhood
has
seen
benefits
from
major
earthquakes
.

After
the
1906
earthquake
,
many
San
Franciscans
relocated
there
,
and
the
industrial
development
of
the
20s
and
30s
saw
its
population
in
the
hundreds
of
thousands
.

With
Loma
Prieta
in
1989
,
the
effective
barrier
of
the
Cypress
Street
Overpass
was
destroyed
,
and
the
decades
since
have
seen
the
rebuilding
and
refurbishing
of
many
of
the
neighborhood
's
original
Victorian
houses
,
and
there
is
a
burgeoning
performing
arts
community
growing
near
the
center
of
the
neighborhood
.

Though
there
are
a
few
draws
for
the
traveler
,
West
Oakland
is
dominantly
a
very
poor
working-class
residential
neighborhood
with
a
less
than
spectacular
reputation
.

Respect

Thais
are
a
polite
people
and
,
while
remarkably
tolerant
of
foreigners
gallivanting
on
their
beaches
and
with
their
women
,
you
ll
find
that
you
will
get
more
respect
if
you
in
turn
treat
them
and
their
customs
with
respect
.

The
wai

Ronald
McDonald
showing
how
it
's
done

The
traditional
greeting
known
as
the
wai
,
where
you
press
your
hands
together
as
is
in
prayer
and
bow
slightly
,
is
derived
from
the
Hindu
cultural
influence
from
India
,
and
still
widely
practised
.

Among
Thais
,
there
are
strict
rules
of
hierarchy
that
dictate
how
and
when
the
wai
should
be
given
.

In
brief
,
inferiors
salute
superiors
first
.

You
should
not
wai
service
people
or
street
vendors
.

The
higher
your
hands
go
,
the
more
respectful
you
are
.

You
will
also
often
see
Thais
doing
a
wai
as
they
walk
past
temples
and
spirit
houses
.

As
a
foreign
visitor
,
you
are
not
expected
to
know
how
to
wai
,
nor
to
reciprocate
when
wai'd
to
;

while
you
're
unlikely
to
cause
offense
if
you
do
,
you
may
well
look
slightly
strange
.

If
somebody
makes
a
wai
to
you
,
a
slight
bow
alone
is
more
than
sufficient
for
ordinary
occasions
,
and
for
business
,
most
Thais
will
shake
hands
with
foreigners
instead
of
waiing
anyway
.

Dress

Personal
appearance
is
very
important
in
Thailand
as
a
measure
of
respect
to
other
people
.

You
will
find
that
dressing
appropriately
means
that
you
are
shown
more
respect
in
return
.

This
translates
in
many
ways
,
even
sometimes
lowering
initial
offering
prices
at
markets
.

While
some
allowance
is
made
for
the
differing
customs
of
foreigners
,
Thais
respond
more
positively
to
well-dressed
Westerners
.

Traditionally
,
Thais
are
modest
and
conservative
dressers
.

At
a
minimum
your
clothes
should
be
neat
,
clean
,
and
free
from
holes
or
tears
.

Except
at
the
beach
or
at
sacred
sites
normal
western
dress
is
acceptable
for
both
men
and
women
,
except
that
you
should
avoid
clothing
showing
a
lot
of
skin
.

Pants
are
preferable
to
shorts
,
blouses
should
have
capped
sleeves
,
and
if
tank
tops
are
worn
,
the
straps
should
be
thick
(
i.e.
,
not
spaghetti
straps
)
.

Thai
men
generally
wear
pants
,
and
most
Thais
view
an
adult
man
wearing
shorts
as
fairly
ridiculous
;

shorts
are
primarily
worn
by
laborers
and
schoolchildren
.

Men
's
shorts
should
be
knee
length
or
more
,
if
worn
at
all
.

Taking
off
one
's
shoes
at
temples
and
private
homes
is
mandatory
etiquette
,
and
this
may
even
be
requested
at
some
shops
.

Wear
shoes
that
slip
on
and
off
easily
.

Flip-flops
,
hiking
sandals
,
and
clog-type
shoes
are
usually
a
good
pragmatic
choice
for
traveling
in
Thailand
;

only
in
the
most
top-end
establishments
are
shoes
required
.

It
is
best
to
play
it
safe
with
wats
and
other
sacred
sites
in
Thailand
;

your
dress
should
be
unambiguously
modest
and
cover
your
entire
torso
and
most
of
your
limbs
.

For
men
,
ankle-length
pants
are
mandatory
;

on
top
,
t-shirts
are
acceptable
,
though
a
button-front
or
polo
shirt
would
be
best
.

Many
recommend
that
women
wear
only
full
length
dresses
and
skirts
;

you
should
make
sure
that
your
clothing
covers
at
least
your
shoulders
and
your
knees
and
some
places
may
require
that
you
wear
ankle-length
pants
or
skirts
and
long
sleeved
tops
.

Shorts
and
sleeveless
shirts
are
highly
inappropriate
,
as
are
short
skirts
.

The
rules
are
even
more
strict
for
foreign
visitors
,
so
even
if
you
see
a
local
in
shorts
it
's
not
OK
for
everyone
.

Topless
sunbathing
is
common
by
Western
women
at
many
tourist
beaches
.

At
beaches
which
are
primarily
Thai
visitors
however
,
this
is
not
advised
.

Religion

Monks
are
an
integral
part
of
Buddhism
in
Thailand
,
and
Thai
men
are
generally
expected
to
spend
a
certain
amount
of
time
living
as
a
monk
at
least
once
in
their
lifetime
.

Buddhist
monks
are
meant
to
avoid
sexual
temptations
,
and
in
particular
they
do
not
touch
women
or
take
things
from
women
's
hands
.

Women
should
make
every
effort
to
make
way
for
monks
on
the
street
and
give
them
room
so
they
do
not
have
to
make
contact
with
you
.

Women
should
avoid
offering
anything
to
a
monk
with
their
hands
.

Objects
or
donations
should
be
placed
in
front
of
a
monk
so
he
can
pick
it
up
,
or
place
it
on
a
special
cloth
he
carries
with
him
.

Monks
will
sometimes
be
aided
by
a
layman
who
will
accept
things
from
women
merit-makers
on
their
behalf
.

Theravada
Buddhist
monks
are
also
supposed
to
avoid
material
temptations
and
as
such
,
are
not
allowed
to
touch
money
,
so
offering
money
to
a
monk
is
considered
to
be
a
sign
of
disrespect
in
most
Theravada
Buddhist
cultures
.

Therefore
,
should
you
wish
to
donate
to
a
monk
,
you
should
only
offer
food
,
and
put
your
monetary
donation
in
the
appropriate
donation
box
at
the
temple
.

Those
monks
that
accept
money
are
almost
always
fakes
.

Vava’u
is
a
group
of
more
than
50
islands
in
Tonga
,
about
150
miles
north
of
Tongatapu
.

They
are
either
raised
coral
limestone
or
coral
atolls
.

The
beautiful
harbour
opposite
the
main
town
of
Neiafu
(
known
as
the
Port
of
Refuge
Harbour
)
is
a
common
destination
for
yachties
sailing
the
South
Pacific
.

The
waters
of
the
islands
are
known
for
their
clarity
,
it
being
said
that
you
can
see
the
bottom
at
40
metres
.

The
area
attracts
many
humpback
whales
between
June
and
November
and
there
are
lots
of
companies
organising
tours
to
see
them
.

There
are
numerous
places
to
stay
to
suit
most
budgets
.

Understand

Findings
of
Lapita
pottery
suggest
that
early-Polynesians
were
on
these
islands
close
to
3000
years
ago
.

These
days
there
are
around
20000
people
living
in
the
Group
.

Neiafu
and
surrounding
villages
are
home
to
about
a
third
of
the
Group
’s
overall
population
of
around
20000
,
with
the
majority
of
the
population
living
in
small
villages
on
the
other
islands
.

Neiafu
is
the
official
port
of
entry
for
yachts
coming
to
Vava'u
,
which
attracts
over
500
yachts
every
winter
sailing
season
between
June
and
October
.

A
string
of
islands
and
reefs
along
the
eastern
edge
of
the
Group
shelters
the
area
from
strong
winds
and
ocean
swellS
and
humpback
whales
come
to
these
protected
waters
to
give
birth
.

This
is
the
high
season
for
tourism
;

between
December
and
April
few
people
visit
and
many
tour
companies
and
restaurants
close
down
.

Neiafu
town
is
the
centre
of
activity
.

It
is
on
the
southern
point
of
the
main
island
of
Utu
Vava'u
and
has
an
attractive
setting
on
one
of
the
world
's
most
beautiful
harbours
.

Neiafu
offers
all
the
usual
amenities
including
banks
,
schools
,
tour
companies
,
restaurants
,
cafes
and
bars
,
supermarkets
,
a
market
and
a
hospital
.

It
does
n't
have
a
beach
but
boats
to
one
of
the
nearby
coral
atolls
with
superb
sandy
beaches
are
easily
available
.

Climate

Vava'u
has
a
tropical
climate
with
average
temperatures
up
to
29
ºC
in
January
and
down
to
24
ºC
in
June
.

It
is
sunny
throughout
the
year
.

Between
November
and
April
,
it
is
more
humid
and
thunderstorms
and
cyclones
do
occur
.

From
May
to
September
there
are
southeast
trade
winds
but
during
the
summer
months
the
winds
are
from
the
northeast
.

The
main
islands
are
:
Utu
Vava'u
.

This
is
the
largest
island
,
where
Neiafu
is
found
.

It
is
a
limestone
island
with
heights
up
to
213
m
in
the
west
.

The
island
provides
a
home
to
eleven
indigenous
bird
species
and
contains
Mt.

national
park
,
with
some
of
the
limited
remaining
native
vegetation
.

Tropical
vegetation
includes
the
pandanus
or
screw
pine
,
the
casuarina
,
and
the
mulberry
tree
,
the
bark
of
which
is
used

and
is
connected
by
land
bridge
at
the
most

How
to
Grow
Beavertail
Cactus

The
Beavertail
Cactus
(
Opunitia
basilares
)
,
found
primarily
in
the
Mojave
Desert
and
northwest
Mexico
;
can
grow
to
be
about
24
inches
(
60
cm
)
high
;
has
pads
that
look
like
beavertails
;
and
yields
red
or
purple
flowers
from
spring
to
early
summer
.

Growing
Beavertail
can
be
done
at
any
time
of
year
by
scattering
seeds
in
a
shady
bed
or
,
for
faster
results
,
planting
cuttings
in
a
mix
of
soil
and
sand
and
ensuring
that
they
have
a
bit
of
water
and
plenty
of
sun
.

Read
the
following
steps
to
find
out
how
to
grow
Beavertail
cactus
.

Method
1
of
2
:
From
Seeds

Purchase
Beavertail
cactus
seeds
.

These
can
be
bought
at
garden
centers
or
purchased
online
.

Scatter
the
seeds
.

In
a
shady
garden
bed
,
simply
scatter
the
seeds
on
the
soil
.

There
's
no
need
to
cover
them
,
unless
you
want
to
use
netting
to
keep
the
birds
off
.

Keep
the
soil
moist
until
the
seeds
germinate
.

Make
sure
that
the
garden
bed
is
in
the
shade
.

Beavertail
cacti
seeds
need
shade
to
grow
,
whereas
cuttings
need
plenty
of
direct
sunlight
.

Be
aware
that
growing
Beavertail
cactus
from
seeds
takes
much
longer
than
growing
one
from
a
cutting
.

It
can
take
as
long
as
4
to
4
years
before
you
get
flowers
.

Method
2
of
2
:
From
Cuttings

Obtain
Beavertail
cuttings
.

You
can
purchase
them
online
or
at
a
local
garden
center
.

If
you
already
own
a
Beavertail
cactus
,
you
can
make
your
own
cuttings
.

To
do
this
,
choose
pads
(
the
flat
,
oval-shaped
sections
that
make
up
a
cactus
)
that
are
6
months
old
or
older
and
cut
them
at
the
base
.

In
order
to
form
a
callous
and
prevent
rot
,
cure
the
cuttings
by
sitting
the
pad
upright
in
a
dry
,
dark
place
for
10
to
14
days
.

Plant
the
cuttings
.

Prepare
a
potting
mix
that
is
equal
parts
soil
and
rough
pumice
or
sand
and
fill
the
appropriate
number
of
pots
with
it
.

Make
sure
there
are
holes
in
the
center
of
the
base
of
each
pot
to
allow
for
good
drainage
.

Set
the
cuttings
upright
in
the
potting
mix
about
an
inch
(
2.5
cm.
)
deep
.

If
you
plant
the
cuttings
too
deep
,
they
might
rot
.

Put
some
rocks
around
the
pad
to
anchor
it
in
place
.

Choose
a
spot
for
your
Beavertail
cactus
cuttings
.

If
you
live
in
an
area
with
strong
summer
sun
,
position
the
cuttings
so
that
the
broad
sides
of
the
cuttings
face
east
and
west
while
the
slim
sides
face
north
and
south
.

This
will
prevent
the
cuttings
from
burning
during
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
.

Make
sure
the
spot
is
sheltered
from
any
cold
winter
winds
.

Wait
for
a
month
.

Do
not
water
the
cutting
for
the
first
month
.

The
moisture
in
the
pad
will
provide
enough
nutrients
for
roots
to
grow
.

Too
much
water
might
cause
rot
.

After
1
month
,
roots
will
have
sprouted
and
you
can
water
the
cutting
for
the
first
time
.

Always
let
the
soil
dry
before
you
water
the
cuttings
.

Once
fully
rooted
,
they
are
extremely
drought
resistant
.

Fertilize
the
plants
.

During
the
spring
,
summer
,
and
fall
,
the
Beavertail
cactus
grows
and
will
benefit
from
a
balanced
fertilizer
.

Let
the
cuttings
grow
.

From
the
first
pad
,
many
more
will
form
.

The
second
or
third
pad
will
bear
some
flowers
,
but
wait
before
harvesting
them
or
you
might
affect
the
size
of
future
harvests
.

.

Preheat
the
oven
to
180
oC
/

oF
.

Prepare
the
muffin
tray
by
adding
cupcake
holders
/
cases
.

Put
to
one
side
.

Alternatively
,
use
a
silicone
cupcake
baking
sheet
with
molded
holes
.

Put
the
cider
vinegar
into
a
small
bowl
and
add
the
soy
milk
.

Stir
this
well
and
then
put
to
one
side
.

The
mixture
will
now
curdle
and
this
is
what
should
be
happening
.

Stir
together
the
flour
,
sugar
,
baking
powder
,
baking
soda
and
salt
.

If
you
want
chocolate
cupcakes
,
add
cocoa
(
about
1/2
cup
)
to
this
stage
.

Stir
the
oil
and
vanilla
extract
into
the
bowl
containing
the
soy
milk
and
vinegar
.

Mix
together
.

Add
the
wet
ingredients
to
the
dry
ingredients
and
beat
together
(
by
hand
or
with
an
electric
hand-held
mixer
)
.

Fill
the
muffin
pan
.

Usually
fill
each
paper
cupcake
holder
with
about
1/4
cup
of
batter
.

If
you
prefer
larger
cupcakes
,
then
add
a
half
a
cup
but
make
sure
the
muffin
pan
is
larger
and
the
cupcake
holders
are
bigger
.

Bake
for
18
-
20
minutes
.

If
you
can
smell
the
cupcakes
earlier
,
check
to
make
sure
they
are
n't
browning
earlier
(
this
means
they
're
more
than
ready
)
.

If
you
are
n't
certain
,
turn
off
the
oven
earlier
and
let
them
sit
for
a
few
more
minutes
rather
than
bake
them
into
rocks
.

Wait
for
the
pan
to
cool
down
.

Place
cupcakes
onto
a
wire
rack
to
cool
.

Ice
the
cupcakes
.

The
flavor
of
icing
or
frosting
can
be
improved
by
adding
a
little
of
your
favorite
juice
to
it
instead
of
soy
milk
or
water
.

.

Add
standard
frosting
or
make
vegan
butter
cream
.

Tips

You
can
add
pureed
fruit
for
delicious
flavor
changes
.

One
small
container
of
pureed
fruit
is
sufficient
for
flavoring
(
the
little
containers
that
children
take
to
school
in
their
lunchboxes
.
)

Try
strawberry
,
apple
,
banana
,
apricot
,
peach
etc
.

The
cupcakes
will
not
be
as
light
and
fluffy
,
however
,
so
be
prepared
for
a
heavier
cupcake
if
you
add
fruit
but
the
added
moisture
content
is
a
definite
plus
.

Instead
of
using
vegan
sugar
,
you
can
replace
it
with
equal
parts
maple
sugar
or
rice
syrup

Instead
of
using
vegetable
oil
,
try
substituting
it
for
walnut
or
macadamia
nut
oils
if
they
are
available
to
you
.

Coconut
oil
also
produces
good
results
.

And
olive
oil
works
fine
if
it
's
all
that
's
left
in
the
pantry
.

You
can
replace
the
plain
soy
milk
with
other
flavors
like
chocolate
or
vanilla
if
you
want
to
experiment
with
changing
the
flavor
of
the
cupcakes
.

Experiment
with
the
flavors
of
either
recipe
by
replacing
the
vanilla
extract
with
fragrant
ingredients
like
neroli
orange
oil
,
rosewater
,
orange
blossom
water
or
coconut
extract
.

How
to
Get
Rid
of
Mice
Naturally

Having
mice
in
your
home
is
both
a
nuisance
and
a
health
hazard
.

They
can
cause
property
damage
,
create
a
mess
,
and
produce
unpleasant
smells
.

In
addition
,
repelling
and
removing
rodents
from
your
home
can
be
a
hassle
if
you
do
n't
know
what
you
are
doing
.

It
can
also
be
dangerous
if
you
use
toxic
chemicals
and
poisons
.

It
's
a
good
thing
,
then
,
that
there
are
some
simple
ways
to
effectively
get
mice
out
of
your
home
without
the
use
of
toxic
chemicals
and
poisons
.

Method
1
Discouraging
Mice
Naturally

Keep
your
home
clean
.

Many
times
mice
are
drawn
into
homes
on
the
search
for
food
.

If
there
is
nothing
to
eat
,
mice
will
be
less
likely
to
stay
.

Keep
all
food
stored
properly
in
airtight
containers
or
in
places
that
are
safe
from
mouse
attack
.
[

]

Apply
peppermint
oil
.

Peppermint
oil
is
a
natural
deterrent
.

The
smell
is
simply
too
intense
for
rodents
and
they
will
not
try
to
go
near
it
.

It
also
helps
to
mask
the
scent
of
any
tasty
morsels
that
have
been
missed
when
cleaning
.

It
also
gives
the
house
a
lovely
smell
,
and
is
not
toxic
,
unlike
many
synthetic
chemical
treatments
.

You
can
get
peppermint
oil
in
most
health
food
stores
and
even
some
major
grocery
stores
.
[

]

Place
a
drop
or
two
on
a
cotton
ball
.

Place
a
cotton
ball
under
or
near
your
garbage
can
to
deter
mice
from
getting
into
it
.

Place
the
cotton
balls
in
areas
where
mice
are
likely
to
enter
your
house
,
by
doorways
,
or
heat
vents
,
etc
.

Peppermint
oil
cotton
balls
need
to
be
replaced
after
5
-
7
days
,
depending
upon
the
quantity
of
oil
you
put
on
it
.

Try
growing
peppermint
plants
near
the
entryways
.

You
can
use
the
mint
in
cooking
,
as
well
as
it
serving
a
deterrent
purpose
.

Use
dried
snake
feces
.

Visit
a
local
reptile
center
,
zoo
,
or
pet
store
and
ask
for
some
dried
snake
poo
.

You
can
also
sometimes
find
someone
who
owns
a
pet
snake
.

Place
near
entrances
and
in
places
where
mice
seem
to
go
.

This
will
keep
mice
away
.
[
3
]

Be
sure
to
keep
the
feces
out
of
the
reach
of
children
and
pets
.

Zap
mice
with
ultrasonic
sounds
.

There
are
electronic
units
sold
that
emit
an
ultrasonic
beeping
sound
that
rodents
hate
.

They
should
be
available
at
your
local
home
improvement
store
or
online
.

These
work
only
on
a
single
line
of
sight
,
so
you
need
to
know
the
exact
path
the
mice
are
taking
.

The
units
may
only
work
for
a
short
time
because
mice
can
become
used
to
them
.
[
4
]

Use
a
commercial
,
organic
deterrent
.

Many
companies
that
specialize
in
organic
garden
and
home
products
make
mice
repellents
that
are
better
for
the
environment
than
traditional
poisons
.

Many
of
these
products
use
natural
ingredients
,
such
as
peppermint
,
that
are
known
to
be
disagreeable
to
mice
.

They
will
not
kill
mice
but
they
should
keep
them
out
of
areas
where
the
product
is
applied
.

These
products
should
be
available
at
your
local
gardening
or
home
improvement
center
.

If
you
want
a
specific
product
,
try
doing
a
online
search
to
see
where
it
is
available
locally
.

Get
a
cat
.

A
house
cat
can
take
care
of
the
problem
.

Cats
that
spend
time
outdoors
are
more
likely
to
hunt
to
find
their
own
food
and
may
track
down
that
mouse
.

Just
be
aware
,
not
all
cats
have
enough
energy
,
interest
or
training
to
hunt
mice
.

Kittens
typically
have
to
be
taught
by
the
mother
to
easily
become
a
mouser
.

Well-food
indoor
kitties
might
just
see
the
mouse
as
a
toy
,
and
grow
quickly
bored
of
it
after
scaring
it
half
witless
.

Shelters
and
adoption
agencies
often
do
not
know
if
a
cat
is
a
good
mouse
hunter
,
and
generally
do
not
test
for
this
.

Sometimes
this
information
is
available
,
but
usually
not
.

While
many
mousers
are
great
pets
as
well
,
not
all
are
.

"
Barn
cats
"
may
not
be
socialized
well
with
humans
,
although
used
to
hunting
mice
for
food
.

Even
if
you
do
not
have
a
cat
,
you
can
use
used
kitty
litter
to
deter
mice
.

Place
tubs
of
used
kitty
litter
around
entrances
of
the
house
.

The
mice
will
sniff
the
smell
of
cat
urine
and
clear
off
in
a
jiffy
.

If
you
have
a
large
infestation
,
a
cat
may
not
be
enough
to
totally
get
rid
of
it
.

However
,
once
you
eliminate
the
infestation
,
a
cat
will
probably
prevent
reinfestation
.

Put
your
trash
cans
far
from
your
home
.

Mice
smell
garbage
and
get
attracted
to
your
house
.

If
you
keep
the
cans
away
from
the
house
,
they
are
less
likely
to
take
up
residence
in
your
home
.

Promote
the
nesting
of
birds
of
prey
in
your
yard
.

Build
a
shelter
box
in
your
garden
to
attract
some
onto
your
property
.

This
may
take
some
time
,
but
it
's
worth
the
effort
if
you
can
attract
a
wild
mouse
eater
to
your
yard
.
[
6
]

Make
sure
the
shelter
box
has
no
nails
or
safety
hazards
.

A
barn
owl
is
the
best
.

A
family
of
barn
owls
can
eat
many
mice
in
a
night
!

However
,
you
might
attract
other
types
of
owls
or
birds
of
prey
with
your
nesting
box
.

If
you
plot
multiple
charts
,
you
will
see
a
drop
area
for
multi-chart
fields
.

This
type
of
drop
area
is
not
displayed
for
single
charts
.

Drop

Moving
fields
to
the
category
and
series

When
you
move
a
field
to
the
series
area
,
the
unique
items
of
data
within
the
field
are
displayed
as
data
series
in
the
chart
.

These
series
are
represented
by
colored
data
markers
,
and
their
names
appear
in
the
chart
legend
.

When
you
move
a
field
to
the

area
,
the
unique

,
or

consists
of
one
point
from
each
data
series
.

Category
labels
usually
appear
across
the
x
axis
of
the
chart
,
although
this
can
vary
depending
on
the
type
of
chart
you
are
using
.

Moving
fields
to
the
data
area

Data
fields
provide
the
values
to
be
summarized
in
the
chart
.

When
you
move
a
field
to
the
data
area
,
the
values
from
the
field
are
used
as
the
data
that
is
measured
in
the
chart
.

A
filter
field
is
similar
to
a
page
field
in
a
Microsoft
Excel
PivotTable
report
.

For
example
,
when
you
move
a
Product
field
to
the
filter
area
,
you
can
have
the
chart
display
category
and
series
values
for
one
product
at
a
time
.

Moving
fields
to
the
MultiChart
area

For
example
,
if
you
move
the
Salesperson
field
to
the
MultiChart
area
,
a
chart
is
created
based
on
data
for
each
salesperson
in
that
field
.

In
the
following
example
,
the
Salesperson
field
is
in
the
MultiChart
area
,
but
it
's
filtered
so
it
displays
individual
charts
for
Buchanan
and
Davolio
.

Filtered
Salesperson
field
in
MultiChart
area

Moving
the
category
or
series
fields
to
inner
or
outer
levels

When
a
chart
contains
multiple
series
or
category
fields
,
the
fields
that
are
closest
to
the
data
are
referred
to
as
inner
fields
.

In
the
following
example
,
Year
is
the
outer
field
and
Salesperson
is
the
inner
field
.

The
inner
field
items
are
displayed
as
salespeople
's
names
,
and
the
outer
field
items
are
displayed
as
the
years
1997
and
1998
.

Multiple
fields
in
a
chart

1
Inner
field
items

2
Outer
field
items

You
can
expand
and
collapse
multiple
fields
to
show
more
or
less
information
in
a
particular
field
.

For
example
,
you
can
collapse
the
outer
field
(
Year
)
in
the
example
so
that
the
inner
field
items
are
no
longer
displayed
.

Chart
with
collapsed
field

The
layout
of
a
chart
does
not
have
to
include
all
fields
that
are
available
from
the
source
data
.

If
more
data
is
available
,
you
can
add
fields
to
the
chart
.

For
example
,
if
the
chart
summarizes
sales
revenue
,
and
the
source
data
also
includes
sales
quantities
,
you
might
add
the
Quantity
field
as
a
data
field
to
summarize
both
revenue
and
quantity
of
products
sold
.

You
can
also
remove
fields
from
the
chart
layout
that
you
no
longer
want
to
see
.

Impact
of
changing
layout
on
filtering

Filter
settings
are
retained
when
you
move
or
remove
a
field
.

This
means
that
when
you
move
a
series
or
category
field
to
the
filter
area
and
back
,
previously
hidden
items
are
again
hidden
.

If
you
remove
a
field
and
later
add
the
field
back
to
the
layout
,
the
same
items
are
again
hidden
.

Restricting
use
of
a
chart

When
you
design
a
chart
for
other
users
,
you
can
restrict
the
user
's
ability
to
change
the
layout
of
the
chart
by
preventing
fields
from
being
added
and
moved
.

About
the
data
outline

The
data
outline
displays
a
tree
view
of
the
data
model
of
a
data
access
page
.

It
lists
the
record
sources
,
fields
,
and
calculated
controls
of
a
page
.

Because
the
field
list
of
a
page
does
not
show
the
contents
specific
to
a
page
,
you
can
use
the
data
outline
to
review
the
structure
of
a
page
.

You
can
also
select
the
objects
displayed
in
the
data
outline
,
set
their
properties
,
define
and
edit
relationships
between
record
sources
,
and
delete
fields
and
record
sources
.

The
following
illustration
shows
the
Orders
page
with
two
group
levels
.

The
inner
group
level
contains
fields
from
the
OrderDetails
table
and
a
calculated
control
named
Value
.

In
the
outer
group
level
,
the
header
section
contains
fields
from
the
Orders
table
and
the
footer
section
contains
a
calculated
total
control
named
OrderValue
.

Text
fields

You
can
group
based
on
the
first
n
characters
of
the
individual
items
.

For
example
,
you
can
group
the
LastName
field
by
first
letter
to
create
groups
,
such
as
A
,
B
,
and
so
on
.

You
can
specify
the
start
and
end
values
for
the
grouping
range
.

For
example
,
if
you
specify
the
start
range
as
01-Jul-1999
while
grouping
the
ShippedDate
field
in
weekly
intervals
,
the
following
groups
will
be
created
:

01-Jul-1999
,
01-Jul-1999
,
08-Jul-1999
,
.

Dates
prior
to
01-Jul-1999
are
grouped
into
a
single
group
titled
01-Jul-1999
.

If
you
also
specify
the
end
value
as
31-Dec-1999
,
the
following
groups
will
be
created
:

31-Dec-1999

31-Dec-1999
,
31-Dec-1999

Dates
that
fall
after
31-Dec-1999
are
grouped
into
a
single
group
titled
31-Dec-1999
.

Custom
grouping
in
PivotTable
view

You
can
randomly
select
items
from
a
row
or
column
field
and
group
them
into
higher-level
groups
.

For
example
,
you
can
select
from
the
Promotions
row
field
all
the
promotions
that
run
for
a
specific
period
and
create
a
group
.

This
would
add
a
new
row
field
named
Promotions
2
above
the
Promotions
row
field
with
two
members
:
Group1
and
Other
.

You
can
change
the
caption
of
Group
1
to
Fixed
and
Promotions
2
to
Category
in
the
Properties
dialog
box
.

The
Other
group
will
contain
all
items
that
you
did
not
include
in
the
Fixed
custom
group
.

You
can
then
select
all
the
popular
promotions
from
the
Other
group
and
create
a
new
custom
group
that
will
be
captioned
Popular
.

After
you
do
this
,
the
Category
field
will
have
three
members
:
Fixed
,
Popular
,
and
Other
.

The
following
illustration
shows
how
the
PivotTable
view
will
look
after
the
captions
of
the
custom
group
field
and
custom
groups
have
been
changed
.

.

Creating
and
deleting
custom
groups
and
custom
group
fields

You
can
not
group
items
that
belong
to
different
fields
or
items
that
belong
to
parent
items
into
a
custom
group
.

When
you
create
the
first
custom
group
for
a
field
,
a
custom
group
field
is
automatically
added
as
the
field
's
parent
.

Similarly
,
when
you
delete
the
last
custom
group
for
a
field
,
the
custom
group
field
is
automatically
deleted
.

When
you
delete
a
custom
group
that
is
not
the
last
custom
group
in
the
field
,
the
deleted
group
's
members
automatically
move
to
the
Other
group
.

The
groups
you
create
do
not
affect
source
data
.

Moving
a
field
whose
parent
is
a
custom
group
field

When
you
move
a
field
that
has
custom
groups
between
row
and
column
areas
,
the
custom
group
fields
that
are
based
on
the
field
move
with
the
field
.

If
you
move
the
field
to
the
filter
area
,
the
custom
group
fields
are
hidden
.

However
,
the
bound
field
will
show
the
custom
group
hierarchy
in
the
drop-down
list
,
so
you
can
filter
data
by
selecting
custom
groups
or
individual
values
.

When
you
move
the
field
back
to
a
row
or
column
area
,
the
custom
group
fields
will
appear
again
.

You
can
not
move
a
field
with
custom
groups
to
the
detail
area
.

Adding
and
removing
nested
custom
groups

You
can
select
two
or
more
custom
groups
to
create
a
higher-level
grouping
.

For
example
,
you
can
group
the
members
of
the
Category
field
into
two
groups
:
high
priority
promotions
and
low
priority
promotions
.

The
following
illustration
shows
how
the
row
area
will
look
with
nested
custom
groups
.

You
can
also
remove

custom
group
.

The

what
the

will
look
like
after
the

Use
a
grid
of
grouped
lines
as
a
table
for
displaying
data

In
Design
view
of
a
form
or
report
,
create
a
grid
of
lines
.

For
example
,
your
grid
might
look
like
following
:

A
more
complex
grid
made
of
seven
lines

Click
outside
of
the
grid
of
lines
and
drag
a
rectangle
over
the
grid
.

On
the
Format
menu
,
click
Group
.

Move
a
line
in
a
grid
of
grouped
lines

Click
the
grid
of
grouped
lines
.

While
holding
down
the
ALT
key
,
click
the
line
you
want
to
move
.

When
the
pointer
changes
to
a
double-headed
arrow
,
you
can
drag
the
line
to
a
new
location
.

Rules
for
moving
an
interior
vertical
line

If
you
move
the
line
to
the
right
,
the
distance
between
the
moving
line
and
the
nearest
parallel
line
to
the
right
remains
constant
,
and
the
perpendicular
line
to
the
left
of
the
moving
line
lengthens
.

If
you
move
the
line
to
the
left
,
the
distance
between
the
moving
line
and
the
nearest
parallel
line
to
the
right
remains
constant
,
and
the
perpendicular
line
to
the
left
of
the
moving
line
contracts
.

At
the
back
table
sat
two
old
men
in
shabby
clothes
,
one
very
fat
and
the
other
very
thin
,
intently
studying
the
racing
forms
.

Two
empty
coffee
cups
sat
on
the
table
between
them
.

In
the
foreground
,
facing
the
magazine
rack
,
a
young
student
stood
with
an
open
magazine
in
his
hands
,
staring
at
a
picture
of
a
naked
woman
.

Quinn
sat
down
at
the
counter
and
ordered
a
hamburger
and
a
coffee
.

As
the
counterman
swung
into
action
,
he
spoke
over
his
shoulder
to
Quinn
.

Did
you
see
game
tonight
,
man
?

I
missed
it
.
Anything
good
to
report
?

What
do
you
think
?

For
several
years
Quinn
had
been
having
the
same
conversation
with
this
man
,
whose
name
he
did
not
know
.

Once
,
when
he
had
been
in
the
luncheonette
,
they
had
talked
about
baseball
,
and
now
,
each
time
Quinn
came
in
,
they
continued
to
talk
about
it
.

In
the
winter
,
the
talk
was
of
trades
,
predictions
,
memories
.

During
the
seasons
,
it
was
always
the
most
recent
game
.

They
were
both
Mets
fans
,
and
the
hopelessness
of
that
passion
had
created
a
bond
between
them
.

The
counterman
shook
his
head
.

First
two
times
up
,
Kingsman
hits
solo
shots
,
he
said
.
Boom
,
boom
.
Big
mothers
–
all
the
way
to
the
moon
.

Jones
is
pitching
good
for
once
and
things
do
n't
look
too
bad
.

It
's
two
to
one
,
bottom
of
the
ninth
.

Pittsburgh
gets
men
on
second
and
third
,
one
out
,
so
the
Mets
go
to
the
bullpen
for
Allen
.

He
walks
the
next
guy
to
load
them
up
.

The
Mets
bring
the
corners
in
for
a
force
at
home
,
or
maybe
they
can
get
the
double
play
if
it
's
hit
up
the
middle
.

Pena
comes
up
and
chicken-shits
a
little
grounder
to
first
and
the
fucker
goes
through
Kingman
's
legs
.

Two
men
score
,
and
that
's
it
,
bye-bye
New
York
.

Dave
Kingman
is
a
turd
,
said
Quinn
,
biting
into
his
hamburger
.

But
watch
out
for
Foster
,
said
the
counterman
.

Foster
's
washed
up
.
A
has-been
.
A
mean-faced
bozo
.
Quinn
chewed
his
food
carefully
,
feeling
with
his
tongue
for
stray
bits
of
bone
.

They
should
ship
him
back
to
Cincinatti
by
express
mail
.

Yeah
,
said
the
counterman
.

But
they
'll
be
tough
.
Better
than
last
year
,
anyway
.

I
do
n't
know
,
said
Quinn
,
taking
another
bite
.

It
looks
good
on
paper
,
but
what
do
they
really
have
?

Stearns
is
always
getting
hurt
.

They
have
minor
leaguers
at
second
and
short
,
and
Brooks
ca
n't
keep
his
mind
on
the
game
.

Mookie
's
good
,
but
he
's
raw
,
and
they
ca
n't
even
decide
who
to
put
in
right
.

There
's
still
Rusty
,
of
course
,
but
he
's
too
fat
to
run
anymore
.

And
as
for
the
pitching
,
forget
it
.

You
and
I
could
go
over
to
Shea
tomorrow
and
get
hired
as
the
top
two
starters
.

Maybe
I
make
you
the
manager
,
said
the
counterman
.

You
could
tell
those
fuckers
where
to
get
off
.

You
bet
your
bottom
dollar
,
said
Quinn
.

After
he
finished
eating
,
Quinn
wandered
over
to
the
stationery
shelves
.

A
shipment
of
new
notebooks
had
come
in
,
and
the
pile
was
impressive
,
a
beautiful
array
of
blues
and
greens
and
reds
and
yellows
.

He
picked
one
up
and
saw
that
the
pages
had
the
narrow
lines
he
preferred
.

Quinn
did
all
his
writing
with
a
pen
,
using
a
typewriter
only
for
final
drafts
,
and
he
was
always
on
the
lookout
for
good
spiral
notebooks
.

Now
that
he
had
embarked
on
the
Stillman
case
,
he
felt
that
a
new
notebook
was
in
order
.

It
would
be
helpful
to
have
a
separate
place
to
record
his
thoughts
,
his
observations
,
and
his
questions
.

In
that
way
,
perhaps
,
things
might
not
get
out
of
control
.

He
looked
through
the
pile
,
trying
to
decide
which
one
to
pick
.

For
reasons
that
were
never
made
clear
to
him
,
he
suddenly
felt
an
irresistible
urge
for
a
particular
red
notebook
at
the
bottom
.

He
pulled
it
out
and
examined
it
,
gingerly
fanning
the
pages
with
his
thumb
.

He
was
at
a
loss
to
explain
to
himself
why
he
found
it
so
appealing
.

It
was
a
standard
eight-and-a-half-by-eleven
notebook
with
one
hundred
pages
.

But
something
about
it
seemed
to
call
out
to
him
–
as
if
its
unique
destiny
in
the
world
was
to
hold
the
words
that
came
from
his
pen
.

Almost
embarrassed
by
the
intensity
of
his
feelings
,
Quinn
tucked
the
red
notebook
under
his
arm
,
walked
over
to
the
cash
register
,
and
bought
it
.

He
made
it
to
Grand
Central
well
in
advance
.

Stillman
's
train
was
not
due
to
arrive
until
six-forty-one
,
but
Quinn
wanted
time
to
study
the
geography
of
the
place
,
to
make
sure
that
Stillman
would
not
be
able
to
slip
away
from
him
.

As
he
emerged
from
the
subway
and
entered
the
great
hall
,
he
saw
by
the
clock
that
it
was
just
past
four
.

Already
the
station
had
begun
to
fill
with
the
rush-hour
crowd
.

Making
his
way
through
the
press
of
oncoming
bodies
,
Quinn
made
a
tour
of
the
numbered
gates
,
looking
for
hidden
staircases
,
unmarked
exits
,
dark
alcoves
.

He
concluded
that
a
man
determined
to
disappear
could
do
so
without
much
trouble
.

He
would
have
to
hope
that
Stillman
had
not
been
warned
that
he
would
be
there
.

If
that
were
the
case
,
and
Stillman
managed
to
elude
him
,
it
would
mean
that
Virginia
Stillman
was
responsible
.

There
was
no
one
else
.

It
solaced
him
to
know
that
he
had
an
alternate
plan
if
things
went
awry
.

If
Stillman
did
not
show
up
,
Quinn
would
go
straight
to
69th
Street
and
confront
Virginia
Stillman
with
what
he
knew
.

As
he
wandered
through
the
station
,
he
reminded
himself
of
who
he
was
supposed
to
be
.

The
effect
of
being
Paul
Auster
,
he
had
begun
to
learn
,
was
not
altogether
unpleasant
.

Although
he
still
had
the
same
body
,
the
same
mind
,
the
same
thoughts
,
he
felt
as
though
he
had
somehow
been
taken
out
of
himself
,
as
if
he
no
longer
had
to
walk
around
with
the
burden
of
his
own
consciousness
.

By
a
simple
trick
of
the
intelligence
,
a
deft
little
twist
of
naming
,
he
felt
incomparably
lighter
and
freer
.

At
the
same
time
,
he
knew
it
was
all
an
illusion
.

But
there
was
a
certain
comfort
in
that
.

He
had
not
really
lost
himself
;
he
was
merely
pretending
,
and
he
could
return
to
being
Quinn
whenever
he
wished
.

The
fact
that
there
was
now
a
purpose
to
his
being
Paul
Auster
–
a
purpose
that
was
becoming
more
and
more
important
to
him
–
served
as
a
kind
of
moral
justification
for
the
charade
and
absolved
him
of
having
to
defend
his
lie
.

For
imagining
himself
as
Auster
had
become
synonymous
in
his
mind
with
doing
good
in
the
world
.

He
wandered
through
the
station
,
then
,
as
if
inside
the
body
of
Paul
Auster
,
waiting
for
Stillman
to
appear
.

He
looked
up
at
the
vaulted
ceiling
of
the
great
hall
and
studied
the
fresco
of
constellations
.

There
were
light
bulbs
representing
the
stars
and
line
drawings
of
the
celestial
figures
.

Quinn
had
never
been
able
to
grasp
the
connection
between
the
constellations
and
their
names
.

As
a
boy
he
had
spent
many
hours
under
the
night
sky
trying
to
tally
the
clusters
of
pinprick
lights
with
the
shapes
of
bears
,
bulls
,
archers
,
and
water
carriers
.

But
nothing
had
ever
come
of
it
,
and
he
had
felt
stupid
,
as
though
there
were
a
blind
spot
in
the
center
of
his
brain
.

In
spite
of
everything
,
it
was
impossible
for
Quinn
not
to
feel
glad
of
this
.

They
sat
there
for
a
short
time
without
saying
anything
.

At
last
,
Auster
gave
a
little
shrug
,
which
seemed
to
acknowledge
that
they
had
come
to
an
impasse
.

He
stood
up
and
said
,
I
was
about
to
make
some
lunch
for
myself
.

It
's
no
trouble
making
it
for
two
.

Quinn
hesitated
.

It
was
as
though
Auster
had
read
his
thoughts
,
divining
the
thing
he
wanted
most
–
to
eat
,
to
have
an
excuse
to
stay
a
while
.

I
really
should
be
going
,
he
said
.

But
yes
,
thank
you
.
A
little
food
ca
n't
do
any
harm
.

How
does
a
ham
omelette
sound
?

Sounds
good
.

Auster
retreated
to
the
kitchen
to
prepare
the
food
.

Quinn
would
have
liked
to
offer
to
help
,
but
he
could
not
budge
.

His
body
felt
like
a
stone
.

For
want
of
any
other
idea
,
he
closed
his
eyes
.

In
the
past
,
it
had
sometimes
comforted
him
to
make
the
world
disappear
.

This
time
,
however
,
Quinn
found
nothing
interesting
inside
his
head
.

It
seemed
as
though
things
had
ground
to
a
halt
in
there
.

Then
,
from
the
darkness
,
he
began
to
hear
a
voice
,
a
chanting
,
idiotic
voice
that
sang
the
same
sentence
over
and
over
again
:
You
ca
n't
make
an
omelette
without
breaking
eggs
.

He
opened
his
eyes
to
make
the
words
stop
.

There
was
bread
and
butter
,
more
beer
,
knives
and
forks
,
salt
and
pepper
,
napkins
,
and
omelettes
,
two
of
them
,
oozing
on
white
plates
.

Quinn
ate
with
crude
intensity
,
polishing
off
the
meal
in
what
seemed
a
matter
of
seconds
.

After
that
,
he
made
a
great
effort
to
be
calm
.

Tears
lurked
mysteriously
behind
his
eyes
,
and
his
voice
seemed
to
tremble
as
he
spoke
,
but
somehow
he
managed
to
hold
his
own
.

To
prove
that
he
was
not
a
self-obsessed
ingrate
,
he
began
to
question
Auster
about
his
writing
.

Auster
was
somewhat
reticent
about
it
,
but
at
last
he
conceded
that
he
was
working
on
a
book
of
essays
.
The
current
piece
was
about
Don
Quixote
.

One
of
my
favourite
books
,
said
Quinn
.

Yes
,
mine
too
.

There
's
nothing
like
it
.

Quinn
asked
him
about
the
essay
.

I
suppose
you
can
call
it
speculative
,
since
I
'm
not
really
out
to
prove
anything
.

In
fact
,
it
's
all
done
tounge-in-cheek
.

An
imaginative
reading
,
I
guess
you
could
say
.

What
's
the
gist
?

It
mostly
has
to
do
with
the
authorship
of
the
book
.
Who
wrote
it
,
and
how
it
was
written
.

Is
there
any
question
?

Of
course
not
.
But
I
mean
the
book
inside
the
book
Cervantes
wrote
,
the
one
he
imagined
he
was
writing
.

Ah
.

It
's
quite
simple
.

Cervantes
,
if
you
remember
,
goes
to
great
lengths
to
convince
the
reader
that
he
is
not
the
author
.

The
book
,
he
says
,
was
written
in
Arabic
by
Cid
Hamete
Benengali
.

Cervantes
describes
how
he
discovered
the
manuscript
by
chance
one
day
in
the
market
at
Toledo
.

He
hires
someone
to
translate
it
for
him
into
Spanish
,

and
thereafter
he
presents
himself
as
no
more
than
the
editor
of
the
translation
.

In
fact
,
he
can
not
even
vouch
for
the
accuracy
of
the
translation
itself
.

And
yet
he
goes
on
to
say
,
Quinn
added
,
that
Cid
Hamete
Benengali
's
is
the
only
true
version
of
Don
Quixote
's
story
.

All
the
other
versions
are
frauds
,
written
by
impostors
.

He
makes
a
great
point
of
insisting
that
everything
in
the
book
really
happened
in
the
world
.

Exactly
.

Because
the
book
after
all
is
an
attack
on
the
dangers
of
the
make-believe
.

He
could
n't
very
well
offer
a
work
of
the
imagination
to
do
that
,
could
he
?

He
had
to
claim
that
it
was
real
.

Still
,
I
've
always
suspected
that
Cervantes
devoured
those
old
romances
.

You
ca
n't
hate
something
so
violently
unless
a
part
of
you
also
loves
it
.

In
some
sense
,
Don
Quixote
was
just
a
stand-in
for
himself
.

I
agree
with
you
.

What
better
portrait
of
a
writer
than
to
show
a
man
who
has
been
bewitched
by
books
?

Precisely
.

In
any
case
,
since
the
book
is
supposed
to
be
real
,
it
follows
that
the
story
has
to
be
written
by
an
eyewitness
to
the
events
that
take
place
in
it
.

But
Cid
Hamete
,
the
acknowledged
author
,
never
makes
an
appearance
.

Not
once
does
he
claim
to
be
present
at
what
happens
.

So
,
my
question
is
this
:
who
is
Cid
Hamete
Benengali
?

Yes
,
I
see
what
you
're
getting
at
.

The
theory
I
present
in
the
essay
is
that
he
is
actually
a
combination
of
four
different
people
.

Sancho
Panza
is
of
course
the
witness
.

There
's
no
other
candidate
–
since
he
is
the
only
one
who
accompanies
Don
Quixote
on
all
his
adventures
.

But
Sancho
can
neither
read
nor
write
.

Therefore
,
he
can
not
be
the
author
.

On
the
other
hand
,
we
know
that
Sancho
has
a
great
gift
for
language
.

In
spite
of
his
inane
malapropisms
,
he
can
talk
circles
around
everyone
else
in
the
book
.

It
seems
perfectly
possible
to
me
that
he
dictated
the
story
to
someone
else
–
namely
,
to
the
barber
and
the
priest
,
Don
Quixote
's
good
friends
.

They
put
the
story
into
proper
literary
form
–
in
Spanish
–
and
then
turned
the
manuscript
over
to
Samson
Carrasco
,
the
bachelor
from
Salamanca
,
who
proceeded
to
translate
it
into
Arabic
.

Cervantes
found
the
translation
,
had
it
rendered
back
into
Spanish
,
and
then
published
the
book
The
Adventures
of
Don
Quixote
.

But
why
would
Sancho
and
the
others
go
to
all
that
trouble
?

To
cure
Don
Quixote
of
his
madness
.

They
want
to
save
their
friend
.

Remember
,
at
the
beginning
they
burn
his
books
of
chivalry
,
but
that
has
no
effect
.

The
Knight
of
the
Sad
Countenance
does
not
give
up
his
obsessions
.

Then
,
at
one
time
or
another
,
they
all
go
out
looking
for
him
in
various
disguises
–
as
a
woman
in
distress
,
as
the
Knight
of
the
Mirrors
,
as
the
Knight
of
the
White
Moon
–
in
order
to
lure
Don
Quixote
back
home
.

Do
you
know
what
a
physicist
is
?

Do
you
recognize
the
name
of
Einstein
?
"

"
Never
.

Who
is
he
?
"

This
is
too
much
for
me
.

Silent
,
I
give
his
case
some
thought
.

Busy-minded
people
,
with
their
head-culture
that
touches
all
surfaces
,
have
heard
of
Einstein
.

But
do
they
know
what
they
have
heard
?

A
majority
do
not
.

These
Hasidim
choose
not
to
know
.

By
and
by
I
open
a
paperback
and
try
to
lose
myself
in
mere
politics
.

A
dozen
Hasidim
in
the
lavatory
queue
stare
down
at
us
.

We
land
and
spill
out
and
go
our
separate
ways
.

At
the
baggage
carousel
I
see
my
youthful
Hasid
again
and
we
take
a
final
look
at
each
other
.

In
me
he
sees
what
deformities
the
modern
age
can
produce
in
the
seed
of
Abraham
.

In
him
I
see
a
piece
of
history
,
an
antiquity
.

It
is
rather
as
if
Puritans
in
seventeenth-century
dress
and
observing
seventeenth-century
customs
were
to
be
found
still
living
in
Boston
or
Plymouth
.

Israel
,
which
receives
us
impartially
,
is
accustomed
to
strange
arrivals
.

But
then
Israel
is
something
else
again
.

We
are
staying
in
Jerusalem
as
guests
of
the
Mishkenot
Sha'ananim
,
the
dwellings
of
serenity
.

Mayor
Teddy
Kollek
,
irrepressible
organizer
of
wonderful
events
(
some
of
them
too
rich
for
my
blood
)
,
takes
us
to
dinner
with
one
of
the
Armenian
Archbishops
in
the
Old
City
.

On
the
rooftop
patio
of
the
opulent
apartment
are
tubs
of
fragrant
flowers
.

The
moon
is
nearly
full
.

Below
is
the
church
,
portions
of
which
go
back
to
the
fourth
century
.

The
Archbishop
is
,
to
use
an
old
word
,
a
portly
man
.

His
cassock
,
dark
red
,
swells
with
the
body
.

On
his
breast
two
ball-point
pens
are
clipped
between
the
buttons
.

He
has
a
full
youthful
clever
face
;
a
black
beard
,
small
and
tidy
.

The
eyes
are
green
.

Present
are
Isaac
Stern
;
Alexander
Schneider
,
formerly
of
the
Budapest
String
Quartet
;
Kollek
's
son
,
Amos
;
two
Israeli
couples
whom
I
can
not
identify
;
and
the
foreign-news
editor
of
Le
Monde
,
Michel
Tatu
.

In
the
Archbishop
's
drawing
room
are
golden
icons
.

In
illuminated
cases
are
ancient
objects
.

I
can
seldom
get
up
much
interest
in
such
cases
and
objects
.

Middle-aged
Armenians
serve
drinks
and
wait
on
us
.

They
wear
extremely
loud
shirts
,
blue-green
sprigged
with
red
berries
,
but
they
strike
me
as
good
fellows
and
are
neat
and
nimble
about
the
table
.

The
conversation
is
quick
and
superknowledgeable
.

In
French
,
in
English
,
in
Hebrew
,
and
occasionally
in
Russian
.

(
Tatu
,
who
lived
for
years
in
Moscow
,
chats
in
Russian
with
Stern
and
Schneider
.
)

The
Archbishop
,
who
has
himself
cooked
the
eggplant
and
the
leg
of
lamb
,
tells
the
company
his
recipes
.

He
and
Kollek
discuss
seasonings
.

Schneider
recalls
a
great
Armenian
musician
and
teacher
(
his
own
teacher
)
named
Dirian
Alexanian
,
editor
of
Bach
's
Suites
for
Cello
Unaccompanied
and
the
most
intolerant
perfectionist

"
Just
as
particular
about
music
as
other
people
are
about
seasonings
.

Alexanian
said
to
Pablo
Casals
after
a
performance
of
some
of
the
suites
,
You
made
three
bad
mistakes
.

Terrible
.

Casals
did
not
answer
.

He
knew
Alexanian
was
right
.
"

Pale
,
with
black
hair
in
abundance
,
Tatu
is
one
of
those
short
men
who
have
learned
to
hold
their
ground
against
big
ones
.

He
sits
with
the
ease
that
disguises
this
sort
of
tension
.

His
paper
is
not
friendly
to
Israel
.

Two
or
three
times
I
consider
whether
to
mention
to
him
a
letter
I
sent
Le
Monde
during
the
1973
war
about
the
position
being
taken
by
France
.

I
want
to
ask
him
why
it
was
n't
printed
.

But
I
succeed
in
suppressing
this
a
triumph
over
myself
.

Besides
,
Tatu
does
not
have
the
look
of
a
man
whose
life
is
easy
and
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
spoil
his
Jerusalem
dinner
for
him
in
his
diary
it
would
probably
be
entered
as
"
An
enchanted
evening
in
Le
Proche
Orient
with
an
Armenian
archbishop
.
"

I
decide
to
let
him
enjoy
his
dinner
.

Seeking
common
ground
with
my
wife
(
a
laudable
desire
)
,
he
tells
her
that
he
too
is
Rumanian
by
origin
.

He
can
safely
say
this
,
for
his
family
came
to
France
in
the
seventeenth
century
.

What
is
all
important
is
to
be
French
,
or
to
have
been
French
for
a
good
long
time
.

And
French
he
definitely
is
.

But
I
can
see
that
the
Archbishop
gives
him
bad
marks
for
lighting
up
after
the
main
course
.

People
of
real
culture
do
not
smoke
at
dinner
tables
.

You
never
know
whom
you
have
asked
to
your
palace
.

Dostoevski
,
no
mean
judge
of
such
matters
,
thought
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
the
murderer
's
point
of
view
.

Navrozov
extends
the
position
.

Liberal
democracy
is
as
brief
as
a
bubble
.

Now-and-then
history
treats
us
to
an
interval
of
freedom
and
civilization
and
we
make
much
of
it
.

We
forget
,
he
seems
to
think
,
that
as
a
species
we
are
generally
close
to
the
"
state
of
nature
,
"
as
Thomas
Hobbes
described
it
a
nasty
,
brutish
,
pitiless
condition
in
which
men
are
too
fearful
of
death
to
give
much
thought
to
freedom
.

If
Hobbes
is
too
nifty
an
authority
,
let
us
think
of
the
social
views
of
Jimmy
Hoffa
.

Or
of
the
Godfather
.

Or
of
Lenin
,
as
Navrozov
accurately
characterizes
him
.

And
this
is
what
America
,
bubbling
with
political
illusions
,
is
up
against
.

So
,
at
least
,
Navrozov
thinks
.

Perhaps
Alexander
Solzhenitsyn
agrees
with
him
in
part
.

Apparently
Russians
are
all
inclined
to
see
us
in
this
way
.

My
own
cousin
,
Nota
Gordon
,
two
years
out
of
the
Soviet
Union
,
says
to
me
,
"
You
are
no
match
for
them
.

You
do
not
understand
with
whom
you
are
dealing
.
"

Nota
held
the
rank
of
captain
in
the
Russian
army
and
fought
the
Germans
until
1945
.

He
was
three
times
seriously
wounded
.

He
has
the
family
look
the
brown
eyes
,
arched
brows
,
dark
coloring
,
and
white
hair
.

He
has
,
besides
,
the
gold
crowns
of
Russian
dental
art
.

Criminals
released
from
prison
during
the
war
served
in
his
company
.

Nota
has
no
swagger
but
he
is
war-hardened
.

There
was
no
food
sent
to
the
front
lines
.

You
ate
frozen
potatoes
,
you
foraged
,
and
you
stole
.

You
could
depend
on
your
criminal
soldiers
to
bring
in
provisions
.

"
I
myself
had
absolute
authority
to
kill
anyone
in
my
command
.

At
my
discretion
.

No
explanations
necessary
,
"
says
Nota
.

We
are
first
cousins
but
he
is
Russian
,
I
am
an
American
,
and
in
his
Russian
eyes
an
American
is
amiable
,
good-natured
,
attractive
perhaps
,
but
undeveloped
,
helpless
:
all
that
Dostoevski
was
to
his
fellow
convict
the
murderer
.

Nevertheless
,
I
see
that
in
a
book
called
Things
to
Come
two
Americans
who
think
themselves
anything
but
undeveloped
and
helpless
,
Herman
Kahn
and
B
Bruce-Briggs
,
are
not
impressed
by
Russian
achievements
.

"
Most
striking
is
the
disappointing
performance
of
Soviet
foreign
and
domestic
policy
since
the
late
1950s
,
"
they
wrote
in
1972
.

"
In
the
foreign
policy
field
the
Soviets
have
had
an
almost
uninterrupted
series
of
defeats
and
disappointments
.

They
have
failed
to
extend
their
influence
in
Europe
.

Their
attempts
to
ingratiate
themselves
with
India
and
other
neutralist
nations
have
gained
them
little
.

For
fifteen
years
the
Soviet
Union
has
been
supporting
the
Arabs
against
Israel
in
the
Middle
East
and
all
they
have
to
show
for
it
is
the
humiliation
of
their
proteges
and
the
capture
and
destruction
of
their
equipment
by
Israel
.

The
Arabs
have
shown
no
inclination
toward
Communist
ideology
and
their
oil
continues
to
flow
to
the
West
.

(
The
only
other
choice
for
the
Arabs
is
to
leave
their
oil
in
the
ground
.
)
"

I
copy
this
out
for
my
own
entertainment
a
specimen
of
illusionless
American
political
analysis
.

These
views
,
no
substitute
for
common
sense
,
are
based
upon
careful
staff
work
at
the
Hudson
Institute
.

The
Messrs.
Kahn
and
Bruce
Briggs
say
in
a
prefatory
note
that
their
book
is
"
basically
an
organizational
product
.

All
of
the
staff
at
Hudson
have
contributed
in
some
way
to
this
work
,
as
have
the
thousands
of
people
with
whom
we
have
discussed
these
issues
at
meetings
,
seminars
,
and
briefings
at
the
Institute
and
other
locations
around
the
world
.

What
the
literary
imagination
faces
in
these
political
times
.

One
of
the
finest
Israeli
writers
,
A
B
Yehoshua
,
speaks
about
this
in
an
excellent
book
of
interviews
,
Unease
in
zion
,
edited
by
Ehud
ben
Ezer
.

"
It
is
true
,
"
Yehoshua
writes
,
"
that
because
our
spiritual
life
today
can
not
revolve
around
anything
but
these
questions
[
political
questions
]
,
when
you
engage
in
them
without
end
you
can
not
spare
yourself
,
spiritually
,
for
other
things
.

Nor
can
you
attain
the
true
solitude
that
is
a
condition
and
prerequisite
of
creation
,
the
source
and
its
strength
.

Rather
,
you
are
continuously
summoned
to
solidarity
,
summoned
from
within
yourself
rather
than
by
any
external
compulsion
,
because
you
live
from
one
newscast
to
the
next
,
and
it
becomes
a
solidarity
that
is
technical
,
automatic
from
the
standpoint
of
its
emotional
reaction
,
because
by
now
you
are
completely
built
to
react
that
way
and
to
live
in
tension
.

Your
emotional
reactions
to
any
piece
of
news
about
an
Israeli
casualty
,
a
plane
shot
down
,
are
pre-determined
.

Hence
the
lack
of
solitude
,
the
inability
to
be
alone
in
the
spiritual
sense
,
and
to
arrive
at
a
life
of
intellectual
creativity
.
"

During
the
Six
Day
War
,
Yehoshua
says
that
he
felt
himself
linked
to
a
great
event
,
that
he
was
within
a
historic
wave
and
at
one
with
its
flow
.

This
was
a
pleasant
and
elevating
feeling
.

But
today
,
unable
to
see
the
end
of
war
,
he
has
lost
the
sensation
of
being
borne
upon
any
such
wave
.

"
You
do
not
achieve
peace
from
history
,
"
he
says
.

The
feeling
of
being
swept
along
and
of
uncertainty
as
regards
the
future
prevents
you
from
seeing
things
in
any
perspective
whatsoever
.

You
live
the
moment
,
without
any
perspective
,
but
you
can
not
break
free
of
the
moment
,
forget
the
moment
.

You
can
not
cut
yourself
off
and
not
read
newspapers
or
stop
hearing
the
news
over
the
radio
for
weeks
on
end
,
as
you
could
six
or
seven
years
ago
.
"

It
is
slightly
different
with
us
.

Our
media
make
crisis
chatter
out
of
news
and
fill
our
minds
with
anxious
phantoms
of
the
real
thing
a
summit
in
Helsinki
,
a
treaty
in
Egypt
,
a
constitutional
crisis
in
India
,
a
vote
in
the
UN
,
the
financial
collapse
of
New
York
.

We
ca
n't
avoid
being
politicized
(
to
use
a
word
as
murky
as
the
condition
it
describes
)
because
it
is
necessary
after
all
to
know
what
is
going
on
.

Worse
yet
,
what
is
going
on
will
not
let
us
alone
.

Neither
the
facts
nor
the
deformations
,
the
insidious
platitudes
of
the
media
(
tormenting
because
the
underlying
realities
are
so
huge
and
so
terrible
)
,
can
be
screened
out
.

The
study
of
literature
is
itself
heavily
"
politicized
.
"

There
is
a
clever
,
persistent
young
woman
who
writes
to
me
often
from
Italy
,
who
insists
upon
giving
the
most
ordinary
occurrences
in
my
novels
a
political
interpretation
.

A
cafeteria
lunch
in
New
York
actually
refers
to
a
meeting
in
Canada
between
Churchill
and
Roosevelt
,
and
a
tussle
with
a
drunk
in
the
hallway
of
a
rooming
house
corresponds
to
D-Day
.

I
am
sorry
to
own
I
began
to
worry
them
.

This
was
already
a
fresh
departure
for
me
.

I
was
not
used
to
get
things
that
way
,
you
know
.

I
always
went
my
own
road
and
on
my
own
legs
where
I
had
a
mind
to
go
.

I
would
n't
have
believed
it
of
myself
;
but
,
then
–
you
see
–
I
felt
somehow
I
must
get
there
by
hook
or
by
crook
.

So
I
worried
them
.

The
men
said
'
My
dear
fellow
'
and
did
nothing
.

Then
–
would
you
believe
it
?
–
I
tried
the
women
.

I
,
Charlie
Marlow
,
set
the
women
to
work
–
to
get
a
job
.
Heavens
!

Well
,
you
see
,
the
notion
drove
me
.

I
had
an
aunt
,
a
dear
enthusiastic
soul
.
She
wrote
:
'
It
will
be
delightful
.
I
am
ready
to
do
anything
,
anything
for
you
.

It
is
a
glorious
idea
.
I
know
the
wife
of
a
very
high
personage
in
the
Administration
,
and
also
a
man
who
has
lots
of
influence
with
,
&c.
,
&c
.

She
was
determined
to
make
no
end
of
fuss
to
get
me
appointed
skipper
of
a
river
steamboat
,
if
such
was
my
fancy
.

I
got
my
appointment
–
of
course
;
and
I
got
it
very
quick
.

It
appears
the
Company
had
received
news
that
one
of
their
captains
had
been
killed
in
a
scuffle
with
the
natives
.

This
was
my
chance
,
and
it
made
me
the
more
anxious
to
go
.

It
was
only
months
and
months
afterwards
,
when
I
made
the
attempt
to
recover
what
was
left
of
the
body
,
that
I
heard
the
original
quarrel
arose
from
a
misunderstanding
about
some
hens
.

Yes
,
two
black
hens
.

Fresleven
–
that
was
the
fellow
's
name
,
a
Dane
–
thought
himself
wronged
somehow
in
the
bargain
,
so
he
went
ashore
and
started
to
hammer
the
chief
of
the
village
with
a
stick
.

Oh
,
it
did
n't
surprise
me
in
the
least
to
hear
this
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
told
that
Fresleven
was
the
gentlest
,
quietest
creature
that
ever
walked
on
two
legs
.

No
doubt
he
was
;
but
he
had
been
a
couple
of
years
already
out
there
engaged
in
the
noble
cause
,
you
know
,
and
he
probably
felt
the
need
at
last
of
asserting
his
self-respect
in
some
way
.

Therefore
he
whacked
the
old
nigger
mercilessly
,
while
a
big
crowd
of
his
people
watched
him
,
thunderstruck
,
till
some
man
,
–
I
was
told
the
chief
's
son
,
–
in
desperation
at
hearing
the
old
chap
yell
,
made
a
tentative
jab
with
a
spear
at
the
white
man
–
and
of
course
it
went
quite
easy
between
the
shoulder-blades
.

Then
the
whole
population
cleared
into
the
forest
,
expecting
all
kinds
of
calamities
to
happen
,
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
steamer
Fresleven
commanded
left
also
in
a
bad
panic
,
in
charge
of
the
engineer
,
I
believe
.

Afterwards
nobody
seemed
to
trouble
much
about
Fresleven
's
remains
,
till
I
got
out
and
stepped
into
his
shoes
.

I
could
n't
let
it
rest
,
though
;
but
when
an
opportunity
offered
at
last
to
meet
my
predecessor
,
the
grass
growing
through
his
ribs
was
tall
enough
to
hide
his
bones
.

They
were
all
there
.

The
supernatural
being
had
not
been
touched
after
he
fell
.

And
the
village
was
deserted
,
the
huts
gaped
black
,
rotting
,
all
askew
within
the
fallen
enclosures
.

A
calamity
had
come
to
it
,
sure
enough
.
The
people
had
vanished
.

Mad
terror
had
scattered
them
,
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
through
the
bush
,
and
they
had
never
returned
.

What
became
of
the
hens
I
do
n't
know
either
.

I
should
think
the
cause
of
progress
got
them
,
anyhow
.

However
,
through
this
glorious
affair
I
got
my
appointment
,
before
I
had
fairly
begun
to
hope
for
it
.

I
flew
around
like
mad
to
get
ready
,
and
before
forty-eight
hours
I
was
crossing
the
Channel
to
show
myself
to
my
employers
,
and
sign
the
contract
.

In
a
very
few
hours
I
arrived
in
a
city
that
always
makes
me
think
of
a
whited
sepulcher
.

Prejudice
no
doubt
.

I
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
Company
's
offices
.

It
was
the
biggest
thing
in
the
town
,
and
everybody
I
met
was
full
of
it
.

They
were
going
to
run
an
over-sea
empire
,
and
make
no
end
of
coin
by
trade
.

A
narrow
and
deserted
street
in
deep
shadow
,
high
houses
,
innumerable
windows
with
venetian
blinds
,
a
dead
silence
,
grass
sprouting
between
the
stones
,
imposing
carriage
archways
right
and
left
,
immense
double
doors
standing
ponderously
ajar
.

I
slipped
through
one
of
these
cracks
,
went
up
a
swept
and
ungarnished
staircase
,
as
arid
as
a
desert
,
and
opened
the
first
door
I
came
to
.

Two
women
,
one
fat
and
the
other
slim
,
sat
on
straw-bottomed
chairs
,
knitting
black
wool
.

The
slim
one
got
up
and
walked
straight
at
me
–
still
knitting
with
downcast
eyes
–
and
only
just
as
I
began
to
think
of
getting
out
of
her
way
,
as
you
would
for
a
somnambulist
,
stood
still
,
and
looked
up
.
Her
dress
was
as
plain
as
an
umbrella-cover
,
and
she
turned
round
without
a
word
and
preceded
me
into
a
waiting-room
.

I
gave
my
name
,
and
looked
about
.

Deal
table
in
the
middle
,
plain
chairs
all
round
the
walls
,
on
one
end
a
large
shining
map
,
marked
with
all
the
colors
of
a
rainbow
.

There
was
a
vast
amount
of
red
–
good
to
see
at
any
time
,
because
one
knows
that
some
real
work
is
done
in
there
,
a
deuce
of
a
lot
of
blue
,
a
little
green
,
smears
of
orange
,
and
,
on
the
East
Coast
,
a
purple
patch
,
to
show
where
the
jolly
pioneers
of
progress
drink
the
jolly
lager-beer
.

However
,
I
was
n't
going
into
any
of
these
.

I
was
going
into
the
yellow
.
Dead
in
the
center
.

And
the
river
was
there
–
fascinating
–
deadly
–
like
a
snake
.
Ough
!

A
door
opened
,
a
white-haired
secretarial
head
,
but
wearing
a
compassionate
expression
,
appeared
,
and
a
skinny
forefinger
beckoned
me
into
the
sanctuary
.

Its
light
was
dim
,
and
a
heavy
writing-desk
squatted
in
the
middle
.

From
behind
that
structure
came
out
an
impression
of
pale
plumpness
in
a
frock-coat
.
The
great
man
himself
.

He
was
five
feet
six
,
I
should
judge
,
and
had
his
grip
on
the
handle-end
of
ever
so
many
millions
.

He
shook
hands
,
I
fancy
,
murmured
vaguely
,
was
satisfied
with
my
French
.

Bon
voyage
.

In
about
forty-five
seconds
I
found
myself
again
in
the
waiting-room
with
the
compassionate
secretary
,
who
,
full
of
desolation
and
sympathy
,
made
me
sign
some
document
.

I
believe
I
undertook
amongst
other
things
not
to
disclose
any
trade
secrets
.

Well
,
I
am
not
going
to
.

I
began
to
feel
slightly
uneasy
.

You
know
I
am
not
used
to
such
ceremonies
,
and
there
was
something
ominous
in
the
atmosphere
.

It
was
just
as
though
I
had
been
let
into
some
conspiracy
–
I
do
n't
know
–
something
not
quite
right
;
and
I
was
glad
to
get
out
.

In
the
outer
room
the
two
women
knitted
black
wool
feverishly
.

A
caravan
had
come
in
.

A
violent
babble
of
uncouth
sounds
burst
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
planks
.

All
the
carriers
were
speaking
together
,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
the
lamentable
voice
of
the
chief
agent
was
heard
'
giving
it
up
'
tearfully
for
the
twentieth
time
that
day
...

He
rose
slowly
.

'
What
a
frightful
row
,
'
he
said
.

He
crossed
the
room
gently
to
look
at
the
sick
man
,
and
returning
,
said
to
me
,
'
He
does
not
hear
.
'

'
What
!
Dead
?
'
I
asked
,
startled
.

'
No
,
not
yet
,
'
he
answered
,
with
great
composure
.

Then
,
alluding
with
a
toss
of
the
head
to
the
tumult
in
the
station-yard
,
'
When
one
has
got
to
make
correct
entries
,
one
comes
to
hate
those
savages
–
hate
them
to
the
death
.
'

He
remained
thoughtful
for
a
moment
.

'
When
you
see
Mr.
Kurtz
,
he
went
on
,
tell
him
from
me
that
everything
here
–
he
glanced
at
the
desk
–
is
very
satisfactory
.

I
do
n't
like
to
write
to
him
–
with
those
messengers
of
ours
you
never
know
who
may
get
hold
of
your
letter
–
at
that
Central
Station
.

He
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
with
his
mild
,
bulging
eyes
.

'
Oh
,
he
will
go
far
,
very
far
,
'
he
began
again
.

'
He
will
be
a
somebody
in
the
Administration
before
long
.

They
,
above
–
the
Council
in
Europe
,
you
know
–
mean
him
to
be
.

He
turned
to
his
work
.

The
noise
outside
had
ceased
,
and
presently
in
going
out
I
stopped
at
the
door
.

In
the
steady
buzz
of
flies
the
homeward-bound
agent
was
lying
flushed
and
insensible
;
the
other
,
bent
over
his
books
,
was
making
correct
entries
of
perfectly
correct
transactions
;
and
fifty
feet
below
the
doorstep
I
could
see
the
still
tree-tops
of
the
grove
of
death
.

Next
day
I
left
that
station
at
last
,
with
a
caravan
of
sixty
men
,
for
a
two-hundred-mile
tramp
.

No
use
telling
you
much
about
that
.

Paths
,
paths
,
everywhere
;
a
stamped-in
network
of
paths
spreading
over
the
empty
land
,
through
long
grass
,
through
burnt
grass
,
through
thickets
,
down
and
up
chilly
ravines
,
up
and
down
stony
hills
ablaze
with
heat
;
and
a
solitude
,
a
solitude
,
nobody
,
not
a
hut
.

The
population
had
cleared
out
a
long
time
ago
.

Well
,
if
a
lot
of
mysterious
niggers
armed
with
all
kinds
of
fearful
weapons
suddenly
took
to
traveling
on
the
road
between
Deal
and
Gravesend
,
catching
the
yokels
right
and
left
to
carry
heavy
loads
for
them
,
I
fancy
every
farm
and
cottage
thereabouts
would
get
empty
very
soon
.

Only
here
the
dwellings
were
gone
too
.

Still
I
passed
through
several
abandoned
villages
.

There
's
something
pathetically
childish
in
the
ruins
of
grass
walls
.

Day
after
day
,
with
the
stamp
and
shuffle
of
sixty
pair
of
bare
feet
behind
me
,
each
pair
under
a
60-lb.
load
.

Camp
,
cook
,
sleep
,
strike
camp
,
march
.

Now
and
then
a
carrier
dead
in
harness
,
at
rest
in
the
long
grass
near
the
path
,
with
an
empty
water-gourd
and
his
long
staff
lying
by
his
side
.

A
great
silence
around
and
above
.

Perhaps
on
some
quiet
night
the
tremor
of
far-off
drums
,
sinking
,
swelling
,
a
tremor
vast
,
faint
;
a
sound
weird
,
appealing
,
suggestive
,
and
wild
–
and
perhaps
with
as
profound
a
meaning
as
the
sound
of
bells
in
a
Christian
country
.

Once
a
white
man
in
an
unbuttoned
uniform
,
camping
on
the
path
with
an
armed
escort
of
lank
Zanzibaris
,
very
hospitable
and
festive
–
not
to
say
drunk
.

Was
looking
after
the
upkeep
of
the
road
,
he
declared
.

Ca
n't
say
I
saw
any
road
or
any
upkeep
,
unless
the
body
of
a
middle-aged
negro
,
with
a
bullet-hole
in
the
forehead
,
upon
which
I
absolutely
stumbled
three
miles
farther
on
,
may
be
considered
as
a
permanent
improvement
.

I
had
a
white
companion
too
,
not
a
bad
chap
,
but
rather
too
fleshy
and
with
the
exasperating
habit
of
fainting
on
the
hot
hillsides
,
miles
away
from
the
least
bit
of
shade
and
water
.

Annoying
,
you
know
,
to
hold
your
own
coat
like
a
parasol
over
a
man
's
head
while
he
is
coming-to
.

I
could
n't
help
asking
him
once
what
he
meant
by
coming
there
at
all
.

'
To
make
money
,
of
course
.
'

What
do
you
think
?
he
said
,
scornfully
.

Then
he
got
fever
,
and
had
to
be
carried
in
a
hammock
slung
under
a
pole
.

As
he
weighed
sixteen
stone
I
had
no
end
of
rows
with
the
carriers
.

They
jibbed
,
ran
away
,
sneaked
off
with
their
loads
in
the
night
–
quite
a
mutiny
.

So
,
one
evening
,
I
made
a
speech
in
English
with
gestures
,
not
one
of
which
was
lost
to
the
sixty
pairs
of
eyes
before
me
,
and
the
next
morning
I
started
the
hammock
off
in
front
all
right
.

An
hour
afterwards
I
came
upon
the
whole
concern
wrecked
in
a
bush
–
man
,
hammock
,
groans
,
blankets
,
horrors
.

The
heavy
pole
had
skinned
his
poor
nose
.

He
was
very
anxious
for
me
to
kill
somebody
,
but
there
was
n't
the
shadow
of
a
carrier
near
.

I
remembered
the
old
doctor
,
–
'
It
would
be
interesting
for
science
to
watch
the
mental
changes
of
individuals
,
on
the
spot
.

I
felt
I
was
becoming
scientifically
interesting
.

However
,
all
that
is
to
no
purpose
.

On
the
fifteenth
day
I
came
in
sight
of
the
big
river
again
,
and
hobbled
into
the
Central
Station
.

It
was
on
a
back
water
surrounded
by
scrub
and
forest
,
with
a
pretty
border
of
smelly
mud
on
one
side
,
and
on
the
three
others
inclosed
by
a
crazy
fence
of
rushes
.
A
neglected
gap
was
all
the
gate
it
had
,

and
the
first
glance
at
the
place
was
enough
to
let
you
see
the
flabby
devil
was
running
that
show
.

White
men
with
long
staves
in
their
hands
appeared
languidly
from
amongst
the
buildings
,
strolling
up
to
take
a
look
at
me
,
and
then
retired
out
of
sight
somewhere
.

One
of
them
,
a
stout
,
excitable
chap
with
black
mustaches
,
informed
me
with
great
volubility
and
many
digressions
,
as
soon
as
I
told
him
who
I
was
,
that
my
steamer
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
.

I
was
thunderstruck
.

What
,
how
,
why
?

Oh
,
it
was
all
right
.

The
manager
himself
was
there
.

All
quite
correct
.

'
Everybody
had
behaved
splendidly
!
splendidly
!

–
'
you
must
,
'
he
said
in
agitation
,
'
go
and
see
the
general
manager
at
once
.

The
proposal
put
forward
by
the
Commission
is
to
be
welcomed
from
the
consumers
'
point
of
view
.

Affected
parties
have
also
criticized
the
fact
that
the
manufacturer
's
public
declarations
are
also
included
in
the
defect
definition
.

Ultimately
that
would
be
a
disadvantage
for
the
consumer
.

They
were
voted
down
and
the
reasons
will
no
doubt
be
put
once
again
by
Mrs
Bonino
.

One
is
the
question
of
second-hand
goods
.

I
believe
that
with
this
hierarchy
we
have
solved
many
of
the
problems
for
small
and
medium
enterprises
.

At
the
same
time
it
could
result
in
job
losses
in
the
labour
intensive
repair
services
sector
.

In
practise
it
turns
out
that
it
is
sometimes
impossible
to
answer
this
question
.

He
is
not
to
blame
.

But
on
the
other
hand
a
good
reputation
will
benefit
him
,
both
with
respect
to
the
product
and
to
his
service
.

The
shopkeeper
will
need
right
of
recourse
which
he
can
use
to
recover
his
costs
from
the
manufacturer
.

Madam
President
,
I
do
not
have
a
script
,
just
two
observations
.

That
is
an
utterly
ridiculous
assumption
.

But
a
degree
of
protection
is
not
the
same
as
absolute
cover
against
a
host
of
things
at
the
expense
of
something
similar
.

What
,
for
instance
,
is
'
appropriate
after-sales
service
'
?

The
same
applies
to
a
whole
series
of
other
examples
we
can
give
.

This
is
a
sine-qua-non
,
and
it
would
seem
unnecessary
to
keep
stressing
it
.

I
believe
that
this
would
be
a
lot
easier
if
consumers
were
involved
.

There
must
be
strict
rules
in
abattoirs
to
maintain
the
highest
levels
of
hygiene
.

Good
farming
practice
and
animal
welfare
can
not
be
considered
in
isolation
from
food
legislation
as
a
whole
.

We
have
to
sustain
the
European
Union
as
a
major
food
producer
and
a
major
exporter
.

Please
allow
me
to
say
that
the
present
report
can
be
judged
very
positively
.

And
I
would
not
want
the
opposite
view
to
arise
through
any
misunderstanding
in
the
present
report
.

So
we
need
to
know
the
results
of
this
debate
and
put
them
into
effect
.

Commissioner
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
I
would
like
to
read
her
speech
to
you
.

Public
opinion
still
has
no
faith
in
the
Commission
's
ability
to
exercise
control
.

Mr
President
,
the
European
consumer
needs
to
have
increased
confidence
in
food
,
not
least
after
the
BSE
crisis
.

In
Holland
and
other
countries
the
original
nature
of
national
identity
is
being
stripped
away
in
the
name
of
chicken
and
pig
feed
.

Would
that
not
be
better
than
total
harmonization
,
which
is
fundamentally
a
commercial
rule
aimed
at
promoting
commercial
interests
,
not
food
quality
?

The
framework
directive
is
part
of
this
process
.

I
have
just
another
brief
comment
on
the
foreign
trade
aspect
.

If
we
are
a
member
of
an
international
rights
community
,
then
we
must
stay
with
it
.

The
vote
will
be
taken
at
12.00
noon
tomorrow
.

It
is
complicated
because
it
deals
with
all
nine
separately
and
it
is
necessary
to
submit
amendments
in
nine
sets
.

Upon
which
safeguards
are
we
insisting
?

With
the
help
of
their
financial
controller
proper
arrangements
will
now
be
legislated
for
.

That
is
the
problem
:
you
can
not
comment
on
things
that
you
have
not
read
.

They
were
set
up
by
the
European
Union
for
a
specific
purpose
.

Our
research
has
shown
that
these
agencies
do
not
need
more
controls
.

Let
us
hope
,
therefore
,
that
the
proposals
of
the
Commission
will
be
sufficient
to
make
sure
this
job
will
be
done
effectively
.

To
a
certain
extent
,
this
reminds
me
of
my
previous
activity
in
the
Committee
on
Budgets
and
in
the
Committee
on
Budgetary
Control
.

We
regret
this
and
reaffirm
our
commitment
to
inform
Parliament
of
all
important
agency
decisions
that
have
a
financial
impact
.

We
take
note
of
that
,
Mr
von
Habsburg
,
and
I
should
be
grateful
if
you
could
provide
us
with
this
letter
.

I
have
it
here
with
me
,
Madam
President
.

If
that
facility
is
available
to
Vice-President
–
and
good
luck
to
him
–
is
it
available
to
other
Members
?

Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
you
are
persistently
confusing
the
Minutes
with
the
Report
of
Proceedings
.

I
have
therefore
voted
against
the
report
.

The
measures
you
described
could
be
improved
and
there
are
others
which
you
did
not
mention
.

Does
the
Commission
have
any
sort
of
long-term
policy
in
mind
here
?

The
situation
is
also
explained
by
the
Asian
and
Russian
crises
,
which
also
deprive
the
European
Union
of
a
potential
market
.

Secondly
,
a
promotion
campaign
should
be
swiftly
launched
within
the
Community
to
increase
awareness
amongst
the
general
public
and
boost
consumption
in
Europe
.

The
taxpayer
who
has
to
pay
for
it
,
the
smaller
undertakings
and
species-friendly
stock
rearing
all
fall
by
the
wayside
.

Nor
have
I
expanded
my
production
.

What
representation
did
the
Commissioner
receive
from
the
United
Kingdom
Government
about
this
dire
emergency
?

The
whole
industry
is
in
crisis
.

In
a
case
like
this
,
those
governments
that
are
still
recommending
increased
production
are
being
irresponsible
.

Measures
should
be
the
same
throughout
the
EU
to
ensure
no
Member
State
gets
an
unfair
advantage
.

Through
you
I
urge
the
Commission
and
the
Council
to
reach
decisions
and
take
urgent
action
following
the
meeting
on
14
October
.

Europe
's
farmers
need
help
now
.

That
just
goes
to
show
the
possibilities
in
our
country
!

But
we
do
not
take
the
view
that
including
a
corresponding
reference
to
this
in
a
recital
can
produce
that
result
.

For
generic
drugs
at
the
end
of
a
patent
or
other
protection
period
are
of
course
useful
.

Further
improvements
were
made
to
the
proposal
in
the
Committee
on
the
Environment
,
Public
Health
and
Consumer
Protection
.

It
will
be
resumed
at
3
p.m
.

First
there
is
the
paragraph
inviting
the
Commission
to
withdraw
its
proposal
.

It
is
very
important
for
us
to
know
that
.

Madam
President
,
in
the
Swedish
version
of
Amendment
No-4
there
is
an
unfortunate
mistake
.

It
is
therefore
very
odd
that
the
original
text
has
been
retained
in
this
amendment
.

The
authentic
text
is
'
under
certain
conditions
'
.

That
needs
to
be
made
very
clear
.

But
business
in
the
audiovisual
sector
is
essentially
done
by
small
and
medium-sized
enterprises
.

Katiforis
report
(
A4-0090/99
)

At
some
stage
in
their
development
all
SMEs
experience
problems
arising
from
their
weak
capital
resources
.

Finance
and
mentorship
should
go
hand
in
hand
.

If
demand
were
to
increase
,
so
too
would
risk
capital
,
regardless
of
whether
the
markets
are
fragmented
or
not
.

This
document
reflects
our
group
's
main
concerns
about
the
future
of
the
ACP-EU
link
.

Areas
vital
to
the
health
of
Europeans
certainly
ought
to
be
prioritised
for
intensified
action
and
initiative
by
the
European
Union
.

Parliament
has
demonstrated
its
great
interest
in
this
area
on
a
number
of
occasions
.

Second
Hautala
report
(
A4-0029/99
)

However
,
I
can
not
support
the
reference
to
abortion
.

But
the
harmful
psychological
effects
that
abortions
have
on
women
are
deliberately
and
constantly
concealed
.

Entitlement
to
free
abortions
equates
with
women
having
the
right
to
manage
their
lives
and
make
decisions
about
their
own
bodies
.

There
is
no
easy
answer
to
the
painful
issue
of
abortion
.

I
am
thinking
here
,
amongst
other
things
,
of
issues
such
as
the
law
on
abortion
.

This
objective
requires
a
comprehensive
approach
to
policy
making
and
the
mobilisation
of
all
policy
actors
.

To
a
certain
extent
,
ensuring
equal
opportunities
for
men
and
women
is
like
trying
to
attain
the
unattainable
.

I
would
very
much
like
to
know
on
what
kind
of
scientific
evidence
the
Greens
are
basing
all
these
amendments
.

Children
and
workers
at
power
stations
were
both
studied
.

We
have
evidence
,
Mr
President
,
but
we
apparently
do
not
have
proof
.

This
is
an
issue
which
affects
aspects
of
everyday
life
.

The
guidelines
and
exposure
proposed
by
the
Commissioner
are
based
on
those
recently
published
by
the
International
Convention
on
Non-Ionising
Radiation
Protection
.

Mr
Tamino
's
proposals
are
therefore
greatly
disproportionate
.

There
are
limited
resources
for
public
health
and
we
must
see
to
it
that
they
are
exploited
effectively
.

The
Commission
's
estimates
of
what
would
be
health-endangering
values
reflect
the
outcome
of
the
research
carried
out
.

However
,
it
is
essential
that
the
rules
should
be
reasonable
.

Electromagnetic
fields
and
their
effect
on
people
are
subjects
that
have
come
up
for
debate
with
increasing
frequency
in
recent
years
.

In
point
of
fact
,
we
still
do
not
have
any
precise
answers
to
the
questions
which
they
raise
.

We
should
be
establishing
limit
values
on
a
Europe-wide
basis
,
but
they
should
be
reasonable
as
well
.

Sweden
has
been
mentioned
in
the
discussion
as
one
of
the
countries
with
satisfactory
limit
values
.

These
are
concentrated
rays
,
but
they
do
not
penetrate
down
to
where
we
usually
are
.

For
one
thing
,
there
is
increasing
concern
,
and
that
is
undoubtedly
true
,
on
the
part
of
experts
too
.

Then
there
is
Amendment
No-12
.

If
necessary
,
the
Commission
will
act
at
once
.

We
must
work
to
end
that
in
a
sensible
way
.

It
is
also
hard
,
on
the
other
hand
,
to
expect
countries
to
surrender
sovereignty
over
their
national
health
systems
.

So
what
should
be
done
?

The
current
policy
is
ripe
for
review
and
the
financial
resources
are
regrettably
very
limited
.

It
is
only
if
the
disadvantages
equal
the
advantages
that
we
should
use
the
precautionary
principle
.

The
Needle
report
on
the
European
Union
's
new
public
health
policy
seems
to
ignore
this
fact
completely
.

Mr
President
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
Mr
Needle
has
gone
to
great
trouble
with
the
hearing
in
committee
.

I
also
believe
that
the
regional
authorities
are
not
all
in
a
position
to
establish
contacts
with
the
Commission
.

The
report
mentions
best
practice
and
standards
in
health
care
.

That
is
in
fact
the
point
of
departure
we
have
chosen
here
and
I
am
very
glad
all
this
has
been
properly
understood
.

Unfortunately
,
at
its
last
vote
on
the
subject
Parliament
approved
these
subsidies
by
a
majority
.

But
Europe
will
not
stand
by
while
the
world
's
trade
rules
are
flouted
.

The
dispute
is
becoming
increasingly
bitter
and
is
beginning
to
look
like
a
trade
war
.

The
European
Union
put
a
new
and
revised
banana
regime
in
place
on
1
January
1999
.

For
that
and
many
other
reasons
we
support
the
motion
for
a
resolution
.

The
United
States
has
shown
that
it
holds
negotiations
in
contempt
.

If
we
do
not
achieve
our
objective
of
resolving
this
dispute
,
then
I
fear
the
WTO
will
slip
on
a
banana
skin
.

He
made
a
resigned
grimace
assuming
understanding
...
My
wife
and
I
decided
we
could
n't
stick
it
any
longer
.

So
we
try
it
out
here
.

I
do
n't
know
;
we
'll
see
.

I
read
you
were
coming
back
,
there
was
an
article
in
the
paper
,
my
wife
Margot
sent
it
to
me
in
Switzerland
,
so
I
thought
it
was
you
.

You
were
just
in
front
of
me
when
we
got
out
in
Rome
.

Yes
,
I
suppose
I
wo
n't
know
my
way
around
when
I
get
into
town
.

Oh
,
it
's
still
not
New
York
or
London
,
do
n't
worry
.

The
man
spoke
with
an
accent
,
and
a
certain
European
kind
of
resignation
.

They
laughed
.

Well
,
in
that
case
,
we
'll
probably
bump
into
each
other
in
Great
Lakes
Road
.

Please
Nkrumah
Road
.

I
said
I
should
have
to
learn
my
way
round
all
over
again
.

The
man
looked
about
quickly
and
lowered
his
voice
.

This
country
can
do
with
a
few
more
white
people
like
you
,
take
it
from
me
.

People
with
some
faith
.

Sometimes
I
even
think
I
'm
down
South
again
,
that
's
a
fact
.

I
've
said
it
to
my
wife
.

A
young
black
man
with
sunglasses
and
a
thick
,
springy
mat
of
hair
shaped
to
a
crew-cut
by
topiary
rather
than
barbering
had
cut
through
the
crowd
with
the
encircling
movement
of
authority
.

This
way
,
Colonel
,
sir
.

Your
luggage
will
be
brought
to
the
entrance
,
if
you
'll
just
give
me
the
tickets
...

The
other
man
,
bobbing
in
the
wash
of
this
activity
yet
smiling
at
it
in
hostly
assumption
of
his
own
established
residence
in
the
country
,
was
talking
across
the
black
man
and
the
exchange
of
pleasantries
,
tickets
,
thanks
:

at
the
Silver
Rhino
,
of
course
,
you
remember
the
place
.

Any
time
...
we
'd
be
very
pleased
...

He
thanked
him
,
listening
to
the
two
men
at
once
and
hearing
neither
,
and
followed
the
firm
rump
in
white
shorts
past
barriers
and
through
the
reception
hall
.

That
's
all
right
,
officer
,
this
is
Colonel
Bray
.

I
'm
looking
after
Colonel
Bray
,
no
need
to
bother
him
.

A
youthful
black
official
at
passport
control
said
uncertainly
,
Just
a
minute
.

I
do
n't
know
about
this
...
but
the
pale
Cockney
who
was
teaching
him
to
take
over
his
job
said
,
That
's
okay
,
chum
,
it
's
our
ole
friend
Mr.
Kabata
.

The
luggage
was
not
waiting
at
the
flag-draped
and
bunting-swathed
entrance
,
where
a
picture
of
a
huge
Roman
emperor
Mweta
,
in
a
toga
,
smiled
as
he
did
in
the
old
photograph
of
the
Gala
village
football
team
.

Mr.
Kabata
said
,
What
's
the
matter
with
these
people
.
Excuse
me
,
I
'll
get
a
boy
,
and
returned
with
the
cases
on
the
head
of
one
of
the
stringy
,
splay-footed
peasants
who
had
always
constituted
the
portering
personnel
.

The
porter
addressed
both
men
as
Mukwayi
,
the
respectful
term
became
servile
during
the
long
time
when
it
was
used
indiscriminately
for
any
white
man
.

There
was
an
official
pennant
on
the
Volkswagen
.

Beside
him
,
Kabata
's
strong
thighs
filled
the
seat
.

It
's
not
too
comfortable
for
a
man
your
height
,
Colonel
.

The
President
will
be
expecting
me
to
have
come
for
you
with
the
Mercedes
,
but
,
honestly
,
if
I
'd
have
waited
to
get
it
I
would
have
turned
up
I
do
n't
know
when
.

You
know
how
it
is
just
at
the
moment
.

Mrs.
Indira
Gandhi
arrives
this
afternoon
and
yesterday
it
was
United
Nations
and
Sekou
Toure
.

There
were
gilded
arches
over
the
old
airport
road
to
town
;
several
men
on
bicycles
wore
shirts
with
Mweta
's
face
printed
in
yellow
and
puce
on
their
backs
.

He
said
,
All
very
festive
,
but
it
was
distraction
;
he
had
the
feeling
of
listening
inwardly
,
watching
for
something
else
.

The
young
man
said
,
You
are
from
Gala
district
.

I
was
.

Why
,
are
you
from
there
?

From
Umsalongwe
.

But
my
mother
is
a
Gala
.

I
have
visited
that
place
.

Oh
have
you
?

Recently
or
when
you
were
a
child
?

Perhaps
I
was
still
there
then
?

I
think
they
'll
be
very
pleased
to
see
you
back
there
.

He
laughed
.

I
wonder
if
I
'll
get
that
far
.

Oh
,
you
must
make
trip
the
young
man
said
proudly
.

I
do
it
to
Umsalongwe
in
ten
hours
.

The
road
is
much
improved
,
much
improved
.

You
'll
see
.

You
could
make
it
to
Matoko
in
,
say
,
six
or
seven
.

My
car
is
a
little
tiny
thing
,
a
second-hand
crock
.

Near
the
bridge
the
women
were
going
for
water
with
paraffin
tins
on
their
heads
.

Advertisement
hoardings
had
gone
up
,
there
was
a
cement
works
,
smart
factories
put
together
out
of
jutting
glassy
sections
and
,
in
between
,
the
patches
scratched
in
the
bush
where
women
and
children
were
hoeing
crooked
rows
of
beans
and
maize
.

The
children
(
an
excuse
to
dawdle
,
of
course
)
stopped
and
waved
.

He
found
himself
waving
back
urgently
,
bending
his
head
under
the
low
roof
of
the
car
,
smiling
and
craning
to
hold
their
faces
when
they
were
already
out
of
sight
.

The
car
was
approaching
,
was
carrying
him
through
the
market
quarter
of
the
town
.

Under
the
mango
trees
,
barbers
'
mirrors
set
up
a
flash
in
the
shade
,
and
live
chickens
lay
in
heaps
with
their
legs
tied
.

It
was
the
mango
season
,
and
there
were
the
saffron-yellow
sabres
of
the
pips
,
sucked
hairy
,
everywhere
where
people
passed
.

The
bird
was
on
the
roof
of
the
round
,
thatched
guest
room
in
the
garden
of
his
old
friend
Roland
Dando
–
a
Welshman
–
newly
appointed
as
Attorney-General
.

When
Bray
was
delivered
to
the
house
there
was
no
one
at
home
but
servants
well
primed
to
welcome
him
.

They
gave
him
the
African
cook
's
special
lunch
that
he
remembered
so
well
:
slightly
burned
meat
soup
with
lots
of
barley
,
overdone
steak
with
fried
onions
,
a
pudding
frothy
on
top
and
gelatinous
underneath
,
tasting
of
eggs
and
granadilla
juice
.

Roly
rang
up
to
see
if
he
had
arrived
,
and
explained
again
–
he
had
done
so
in
advance
by
letter
–
that
he
had
an
official
lunch
to
attend
.

Bray
's
ears
were
filled
with
the
strange
echoes
of
exhaustion
and
,
stoked
up
by
the
hot
lunch
,
his
body
threatened
to
suffocate
him
with
waves
of
heat
.

He
went
into
the
room
kept
darkened
by
drawn
curtains
and
slept
.

There
was
no
ceiling
and
he
looked
up
into
the
pattern
of
a
spider
's
web
made
by
the
supporting
beams
of
the
roof
.

The
underside
of
thatch
that
rested
on
it
was
smooth
and
straight
,
grey
where
it
was
old
,
blond
where
it
had
been
replaced
,
and
,
like
a
tidy
head
,
here
and
there
showed
a
single
stray
strand
out
of
place
.

The
bird
was
probably
balancing
on
the
little
porcelain
conductor
through
which
the
electricity
wire
led
to
the
light
dangling
above
him
.

The
bird
was
gone
;
he
knew
,
almost
as
if
the
breath
's
weight
of
claws
had
pressed
down
the
roof
and
now
the
pressure
was
released
.

The
sun
had
come
round
and
the
curtains
glowed
like
the
sky
above
a
fire
.

Bray
felt
he
must
be
somewhere
about
;
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
this
time
without
him
.

It
was
his
as
much
as
Mweta
's
.

But
no
one
seemed
to
have
seen
him
,
or
to
know
whether
he
was
,
or
had
been
,
in
the
capital
.

There
were
other
faces
from
the
past
;

William
Clough
,
the
Governor
,
lifting
his
bristly
eyebrows
in
exaggerated
greeting
at
Mweta
's
banquet
,
the
way
he
used
to
do
on
the
tennis
court
in
Dar-es-Salaam
.

James
,
you
must
come
and
say
hello
to
Dorothy
before
we
leave
.

I
dare
n't
say
dine
–
we
're
homeless
,
you
know
...

Uncle
Willie
's
Independence
Joke
,
Vivien
said
.
Produces
a
hearty
,
man-of-the-world
laugh
from
Africans
.

The
kind
of
laugh
they
've
picked
up
from
people
like
Uncle
Willie
said
Neil
.

Still
,
the
Cloughs
pursued
Bray
through
Vivien
.

Aunt
Dorothy
says
her
secretary
's
been
trying
to
get
hold
of
you
.

They
want
you
for
drinks
on
Monday
.

I
'd
go
if
I
were
you
,
or
she
'll
tell
everyone
in
London
you
were
buttering
up
to
the
Africans
and
did
n't
want
to
see
them
.

He
laughed
.

No
,
it
's
true

She
says
that
about
me
,
to
my
mother
.

And
she
knows
quite
well
that
we
'd
never
see
each
other
in
London
either
.

The
Cloughs
had
moved
into
the
British
Consulate
for
the
last
week
or
two
before
their
departure
,
a
large
,
glassy
,
contemporary
house
placed
to
show
off
the
umbrella
thorn-trees
of
the
site
,
just
as
in
an
architect
's
scale
model
.

The
consul
and
his
wife
had
been
swept
into
some
back
room
by
the
presence
of
aides
,
secretaries
,
and
the
necessity
to
keep
their
cats
out
of
the
way
of
Lady
Dorothy
's
dog
.

There
was
some
sort
of
scuffle
when
Bray
arrived
...

he
saw
the
consul
's
wife
,
whom
he
had
met
briefly
,
disappearing
upstairs
with
her
head
bent
consolingly
to
a
Siamese
.

Flower
arrangements
were
placed
everywhere
,
as
if
there
were
illness
in
the
house
.

Well
,
the
job
is
done
,
one
asks
nothing
more
but
to
fold
one
's
tents
.

He
's
a
good
chap
,
if
they
'll
let
him
alone
,
he
's
learnt
a
lot
,
and
one
's
done
what
one
could
...

if
he
keeps
his
head
,
and
that
one
ca
n't
be
sure
of
,
not
even
with
him
,
mmh
?
not
even
with
him
.

An
elderly
servant
came
in
with
a
silver
tray
of
glasses
and
bottles
,
and
Clough
interrupted
himself
to
say
with
the
sweet
forbearance
of
one
who
does
not
spare
himself
,
encouraging
where
others
would
give
way
to
exasperation
,
It
would
be
so
nice
if
we
could
have
a
few
slices
of
lemon
...
and
more
ice
?

Yes
,
all
I
've
said
to
Mweta
,
again
and
again
...
make
your
own
pace
.

Make
your
own
pace
and
stick
to
it
.

He
knows
his
own
mind
but
he
's
not
an
intransigent
fellow
at
all
...

well
,
of
course
,
you
know
.

Some
time
ago
...
a
word
in
your
ear
,
I
said
,
you
'd
be
unwise
to
lose
Brigadier
Radcliffe
.

Well
,
they
've
been
clamouring
away
,
of
course
,
but
he
's
refused
to
touch
the
army
.

Oh
,
I
think
I
can
say
we
've
come
out
of
it
quite
good
friends
.

It
was
a
modest
disclaimer
,
with
the
effect
of
assuming
in
common
the
ease
with
Africans
that
he
believed
Bray
to
have
.

He
looked
pleasantly
into
the
martini
jug
and
put
it
down
again
patiently
.

The
elderly
servant
who
brought
ice
and
lemon
had
the
nicks
at
the
outer
corner
of
the
eyes
that
Northern
Gala
people
wore
.

That
's
perfect
.

Thank
you
so
much
.

Bray
greeted
the
servant
in
Gala
with
the
respectful
form
of
address
for
elders
and
the
man
dumped
the
impersonality
of
a
servant
as
if
it
had
been
the
tray
in
his
hands
and
grinned
warmly
,
showing
some
pigmentation
abnormality
in
a
pink
inner
lip
spotted
like
a
Dalmatian
.

The
ex-Governor
looked
on
,
smiling
.

The
servant
bowed
confusedly
at
him
,
walking
backwards
,
in
the
tribal
way
before
rank
,
and
then
recovering
himself
and
leaving
the
room
with
an
anonymous
lope
.

I
'll
pour
Dorothy
's
martini
as
well
,
maybe
that
'll
bring
her
.

If
only
one
could
be
transported
on
a
magic
carpet
...

anyway
,
we
shall
have
three
months
in
London
now
,
with
perhaps
a
week
or
two
in
Ireland
.

What
've
you
been
doing
all
these
years
in
your
ivory
tower
in
Wiltshire
?

Were
you
a
golfer
,
I
ca
n't
quite
remember
...
?

Dorothy
Clough
came
in
and
Clough
cried
out
,
Does
it
fit
?

Come
and
have
a
drink
with
James
...

My
dear
James
...
it
must
be
a
hundred
years
...

We
've
had
a
crate
made
to
transport
Fritzi
,
and
she
's
been
trying
it
on
him
.

My
niece
Vivien
found
a
carpenter
.

She
has
the
most
extraordinary
contacts
,
that
girl
.

It
's
very
useful
!

William
Clough
took
a
pecking
sip
at
his
martini
.
He
said
with
gallant
good
humour
,
Reposting
was
child
's
play
compared
with
this
.

One
has
had
to
learn
how
to
camp
out
...

I
'm
sure
it
's
terribly
good
,
keeps
the
mind
flexible
.

Denis
thinks
your
angle
lamp
's
been
left
at
Government
House
,
did
he
tell
you
?

Dorothy
Clough
sat
forward
in
her
chair
,
as
if
she
had
alighted
only
for
a
moment
.

For
heaven
's
sake
,
let
them
have
it
,
it
's
someone
else
's
turn
to
burn
the
midnight
oil
there
,
now
...

wha'
d'
you
say
,
James
...

Roly
Dando
asked
with
grudging
interest
about
the
visit
.

He
's
never
been
sent
anywhere
where
there
was
anything
left
to
do
,
he
said
.

Clough
only
goes
in
for
the
last
year
,
after
self-government
's
been
granted
and
the
date
for
independence
's
been
given
.

An
early
date
.

Bray
was
slightly
embarrassed
by
gossip
,
when
quite
sober
,
and
said
hesitantly
,
smiling
,

The
impression
was
that
he
and
his
wife
were
slipping
away
quietly
after
the
field
of
battle
.

Since
he
arrived
eighteen
months
ago
there
's
been
damn
all
for
him
to
do
except
go
fishing
up
at
Rinsala
.

At
the
Pettigrews
'
house
that
night
,
Dando
's
voice
came
from
the
group
round
someone
basting
a
sheep
on
the
home-made
spit
:
...
damn
all
except
go
fishing
with
his
secretary
acting
ghillie
...

Rebecca
Edwards
had
just
told
Neil
Bayley
that
Felix
Pasilis
,
the
Pettigrews
'
Greek
friend
,
was
furious
with
her
because
she
'd
forgotten
some
essential
herb
that
he
wanted
for
his
sheep
...

If
I
were
Felix
I
'd
make
you
go
back
home
and
get
it
,
my
girl
,
Neil
said
,
and
the
look
of
inattentive
exhaustion
on
her
rather
heavy
young
face
moved
Bray
in
fellow-feeling
to
distract
attention
from
her
,
saying
,
My
God
,
I
'm
afraid
I
behaved
like
a
child
at
Cloughs
'
!

I
showed
off
by
making
a
point
of
speaking
to
the
servant
in
Gala
.

Neil
and
Rebecca
Edwards
laughed
.

Poor
Uncle
Willie
.

He
was
quite
a
nice
young
man
in
Dar-es-Salaam
.

He
took
Swahili
lessons
conscientiously
and
he
certainly
spoke
it
better
than
I
did
.

To
his
horror
,
the
elf
burst
into
tears
–
very
noisy
tears
.

S-sit
down
!
he
wailed
.

Harry
thought
he
heard
the
voices
downstairs
falter
.

Harry
,
trying
to
say
Shh
!
and
look
comforting
at
the
same
time
,
ushered
Dobby
back
onto
the
bed
where
he
sat
hiccoughing
,
looking
like
a
large
and
very
ugly
doll
.

At
last
he
managed
to
control
himself
,
and
sat
with
his
great
eyes
fixed
on
Harry
in
an
expression
of
watery
adoration
.

You
ca
n't
have
met
many
decent
wizards
,
said
Harry
,
trying
to
cheer
him
up
.

Dobby
shook
his
head
.

Hedwig
had
woken
up
with
a
particularly
loud
screech
and
was
beating
her
wings
wildly
against
the
bars
of
her
cage
.

Dobby
almost
spoke
ill
of
his
family
,
sir
.

Dobby
shuddered
.

Oh
no
,
sir
,
no
Dobby
will
have
to
punish
himself
most
grievously
for
coming
to
see
you
,
sir
.

Dobby
will
have
to
shut
his
ears
in
the
oven
door
for
this
.

Dobby
is
always
having
to
punish
himself
for
something
,
sir
.

They
lets
Dobby
get
on
with
it
,
sir
.

But
why
do
n't
you
leave
?

And
the
family
will
never
set
Dobby
free
.

Harry
stared
.

This
makes
the
Dursleys
sound
almost
human
.

Ca
n't
anyone
help
you
?

Almost
at
once
,
Harry
wished
he
had
n't
spoken
.

Dobby
dissolved
again
into
wails
of
gratitude
.

Dobby
has
heard
of
your
greatness
,
sir
,
but
of
your
goodness
,
Dobby
never
knew

But
he
stopped
quickly
,
because
thinking
about
Hermione
was
painful
.

Voldemort
?
said
Harry
.

He
stopped
again
.

Thinking
about
Ron
was
painful
,
too
.

Dobby
leaned
towards
Harry
,
his
eyes
wide
as
headlamps
.

Dobby
heard
tell
,
he
said
hoarsely
,
that
Harry
Potter
met
the
Dark
Lord
for
a
second
time
just
weeks
ago
.
that
Harry
Potter
escaped
yet
again
.

Harry
nodded
and
Dobby
's
eyes
suddenly
shone
with
tears
.

He
has
braved
so
many
dangers
already
!

But
Dobby
has
come
to
protect
Harry
Potter
,
to
warn
him
,
even
if
he
does
have
to
shut
his
ears
in
the
oven
door
later
.

There
was
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
chink
of
knives
and
forks
from
downstairs
and
the
distant
rumble
of
Uncle
Vernon
's
voice
.

But
I
've
got
to
go
back
–
term
starts
on
September
the
first
.

It
's
all
that
's
keeping
me
going
.

You
do
n't
know
what
it
's
like
here
.

I
do
n't
belong
here
.

He
is
too
great
,
too
good
,
to
lose
.

"
Why
?
"
said
Harry
in
surprise
.

Harry
Potter
must
not
put
himself
in
peril
.

What
terrible
things
?
said
Harry
at
once
.

Dobby
made
a
funny
choking
noise
and
then
banged
his
head
madly
against
the
wall
.

A
sudden
,
unpleasant
thought
struck
him
.

Hang
on
–
this
has
n't
got
anything
to
do
with
Vol
–
sorry
–
with
You
Know
Who
,
has
it
?

Slowly
,
Dobby
shook
his
head
.

But
Dobby
's
eyes
were
wide
and
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
give
Harry
a
hint
.

Harry
,
however
,
was
completely
at
sea
.

Dobby
shook
his
head
,
his
eyes
wider
than
ever
.

Dobby
bowed
his
head
.

Albus
Dumbledore
is
the
greatest
Headmaster
Hogwarts
has
ever
had
.

Dobby
knows
it
,
sir
.

Dobby
has
heard
Dumbledore
's
powers
rival
those
of
He
Who
Must
Not
Be
Named
at
the
height
of
his
strength
.

And
before
Harry
could
stop
him
,
Dobby
bounded
off
the
bed
,
seized
Harry
's
desk
lamp
,
and
started
beating
himself
around
the
head
with
ear-splitting
yelps
.

A
sudden
silence
fell
downstairs
.

What
–
the
–
devil
–
are
–
you
–
doing
?
said
Uncle
Vernon
through
gritted
teeth
,
his
face
horribly
close
to
Harry
's
.

He
stomped
flat-footed
from
the
room
.

Shaking
,
Harry
let
Dobby
out
of
the
wardrobe
.

Friends
who
do
n't
even
write
to
Harry
Potter
?
said
Dobby
slyly
.

Dobby
shuffled
his
feet
.

Dobby
has
them
here
,
sir
,
said
the
elf
.

Stepping
nimbly
out
of
Harry
's
reach
,
he
pulled
a
thick
wad
of
envelopes
from
the
inside
of
the
pillowcase
he
was
wearing
.

Harry
could
make
out
Hermione
's
neat
writing
,
Ron
's
untidy
scrawl
and
even
a
scribble
that
looked
as
though
it
was
from
the
Hogwarts
gamekeeper
,
Hagrid
.

The
moment
she
saw
Harry
,
Ginny
accidentally
knocked
her
porridge
bowl
to
the
floor
with
a
loud
clatter
.

Ginny
seemed
very
prone
to
knocking
things
over
whenever
Harry
entered
a
room
.

She
dived
under
the
table
to
retrieve
the
bowl
and
emerged
with
her
face
glowing
like
the
setting
sun
.

Pretending
he
had
n't
noticed
this
,
Harry
sat
down
and
took
the
toast
Mrs
Weasley
offered
him
.

For
a
few
minutes
there
was
silence
as
they
all
read
their
letters
.

Harry
's
told
him
to
catch
the
Hogwarts
Express
as
usual
from
King
's
Cross
station
on
September
the
first
.

There
was
also
a
list
of
the
new
books
he
'd
need
for
the
coming
year
.

Fred
,
who
had
finished
his
own
list
,
peered
over
at
Harry
's
.

The
new
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
must
be
a
fan
–
bet
it
's
a
witch
.

At
this
point
,
Fred
caught
his
mother
's
eye
and
quickly
busied
himself
with
the
marmalade
.

Oh
,
are
you
starting
at
Hogwarts
this
year
?
Harry
asked
Ginny
.

She
nodded
,
blushing
to
the
roots
of
her
flaming
hair
,
and
put
her
elbow
in
the
butter
dish
.

Fortunately
no
one
saw
this
except
Harry
,
because
just
then
Ron
's
elder
brother
Percy
walked
in
.

He
was
already
dressed
,
his
Hogwarts
prefect
badge
pinned
to
his
knitted
tank
top
.

He
sat
down
in
the
only
remaining
chair
but
leapt
up
again
almost
immediately
,
pulling
from
underneath
him
a
moulting
,
grey
feather
duster
–
at
least
,
that
was
what
Harry
thought
it
was
,
until
he
saw
that
it
was
breathing
.

I
wrote
to
her
saying
we
were
going
to
try
and
rescue
you
from
the
Dursleys
.

Then
he
ripped
open
Hermione
's
letter
and
read
it
out
loud
:

Dear
Ron
,
and
Harry
if
you
're
there
,

I
hope
everything
went
all
right
and
that
Harry
is
okay
and
that
you
did
n't
do
anything
illegal
to
get
him
out
,
Ron
,
because
that
would
get
Harry
into
trouble
,
too
.

I
've
been
really
worried
and
if
Harry
is
all
right
,
will
you
please
let
me
know
at
once
,
but
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
you
used
a
different
owl
,
because
I
think
another
delivery
might
finish
your
one
off
.

I
'm
very
busy
with
schoolwork
,
of
course
–

–
and
we
're
going
to
London
next
Wednesday
to
buy
my
new
books
.

Why
do
n't
we
meet
in
Diagon
Alley
?

Let
me
know
what
's
happening
as
soon
as
you
can
,
love
from
Hermione
.

Harry
,
Ron
,
Fred
and
George
were
planning
to
go
up
the
hill
to
a
small
paddock
the
Weasleys
owned
.

It
was
surrounded
by
trees
that
blocked
it
from
view
of
the
village
below
,
meaning
that
they
could
practise
Quidditch
there
,
as
long
as
they
did
n't
fly
too
high
.

They
could
n't
use
real
Quidditch
balls
,
which
would
have
been
hard
to
explain
if
they
had
escaped
and
flown
away
over
the
village
;
instead
they
threw
apples
for
each
other
to
catch
.

They
took
turns
to
ride
Harry
's
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
,
which
was
easily
the
best
broom
;
Ron
's
old
Shooting
Star
was
often
outstripped
by
passing
butterflies
.

Five
minutes
later
they
were
marching
up
the
hill
,
broomsticks
over
their
shoulders
.

They
had
asked
Percy
if
he
wanted
to
join
them
,
but
he
had
said
he
was
busy
.

Harry
had
only
seen
Percy
at
meal-times
so
far
;
he
stayed
shut
in
his
room
the
rest
of
the
time
.

Wish
I
knew
what
he
was
up
to
,
said
Fred
,
frowning
.

If
we
're
not
careful
,
we
'll
have
another
Head
Boy
in
the
family
.

I
do
n't
think
I
could
stand
the
shame
.

Bill
was
the
oldest
Weasley
brother
.

He
and
the
next
brother
,
Charlie
,
had
already
left
Hogwarts
.

Harry
had
never
met
either
of
them
,
but
knew
that
Charlie
was
in
Romania
,
studying
dragons
,
and
Bill
in
Egypt
,
working
for
the
wizard
's
bank
,
Gringotts
.

Harry
said
nothing
.

He
felt
a
bit
awkward
.

Stored
in
an
underground
vault
at
Gringotts
in
London
was
a
small
fortune
that
his
parents
had
left
him
.

of
course
,
it
was
only
in
the
wizarding
world
that
he
had
money
;
you
could
n't
use
Galleons
,
Sickles
,
and
Knuts
in
Muggle
shops
.

He
had
never
mentioned
his
Gringotts
bank
account
to
the
Dursleys
;
he
did
n't
think
their
horror
of
anything
connected
with
magic
would
stretch
to
a
large
pile
of
gold
.

Mrs
Weasley
woke
them
all
early
the
following
Wednesday
.

After
a
quick
half-a-dozen
bacon
sandwiches
each
,
they
pulled
on
their
coats
and
Mrs
Weasley
took
a
flowerpot
off
the
kitchen
mantelpiece
and
peered
inside
.

We
'll
have
to
buy
some
more
today
ah
well
,
guests
first
!

And
she
offered
him
the
flowerpot
.

Harry
stared
at
them
all
watching
him
.

Never
?
said
Mr
Weasley
.

How
exactly
–

He
took
a
pinch
of
glittering
powder
out
of
the
flowerpot
,
stepped
up
to
the
fire
,
and
threw
the
powder
into
the
flames
.

With
a
roar
,
the
fire
turned
emerald
green
and
rose
higher
than
Fred
,
who
stepped
right
into
it
,
shouted
,
Diagon
Alley
!
and
vanished
.

We
lived
in
a
big
light
spacious
well-windowed
generous
house
,
designed
by
Lutyens
.

My
father
had
bought
it
for
my
mother
in
a
grand
gesture
of
love
and
pride
.

Not
for
her
a
poky
terrace
with
a
dog
kennel
and
an
outside
toilet
.

The
garden
shrubbed
and
green
had
a
noose
of
trees
all
round
it
and
in
the
centre
of
the
rolled
lawn
was
a
Victorian
sun-dial
of
granite
and
slate
.

At
the
bottom
of
the
dial
was
the
hooded
figure
of
Time
scything
the
hours
,
but
at
the
top
,
over
the
position
of
the
twelve
was
an
angel
with
a
trumpet
bearing
the
inscription
'
Aliquem
alium
internum
'
.

I
did
not
know
what
this
meant
and
when
I
was
able
to
translate
it
I
did
not
understand
it
.

Later
it
came
to
mean
a
great
deal
to
me
but
that
is
not
yet
.

His
own
family
were
Liverpool
limeys
;
had
always
worked
the
docks
,
the
boats
,
in
the
Navy
or
as
Merchant
seamen
.

The
women
had
worked
in
the
clutter
of
cargo
offices
up
and
down
the
quays
.

His
mother
,
my
grandmother
,
had
been
the
Official
Polisher
of
Brass
Plaques
and
some
said
that
when
she
had
finished
her
Friday
round
the
shine
of
it
was
so
bright
that
it
tipped
the
waves
like
a
skimming
stone
and
could
still
be
seen
in
the
harbour
of
New
York
.

'
The
other
way
round
.
'

He
had
been
made
a
Director
of
the
Line
.

Yes
.
No
.
The
clock
ticking
and
the
smell
of
buttered
kippers
.

The
young
man
out
of
his
mother
's
body
and
wearing
his
father
's
clothes
.

Be
someone
.
Be
someone
.

Redeem
history
.

Make
our
lives
not
an
endless
sacrifice
but
a
gathering
of
energy
,
the
strength
to
jump
,
but
we
fall
,
until
you
who
leap
and
do
not
fall
.

Then
we
see
what
we
were
for
,
the
single
stuttered
words
gain
the
momentum
of
narrative
.

This
is
the
story
of
a
humble
family
who
became
a
name
.

My
son
David
whose
father
grandfather
and
great-grandfather
unto
the
sixth
generation
worked
the
docks
.

My
son
David
,
rich
,
respected
,
powerful
,
a
man
.

My
son
David
whose
eyes
have
the
shine
of
them
.

My
son
David
pulling
history
home
.

When
she
was
eleven
,
Papa
died
.

Within
three
months
Mother
in
a
little
black
suit
,
child
in
black
warm
coat
,
took
ship
to
Hamburg
and
re-settled
in
Berlin
.

The
books
and
the
bookshop
had
been
sold
and
the
secret
room
was
empty
.

My
grandmother
was
singing
a
hymn
,
essentially
praising
God
but
effectively
preventing
my
father
from
hearing
what
was
happening
.

It
was
a
quick
birth
and
when
I
was
laid
on
my
mother
's
breast
,
my
grandmother
ate
a
sandwich
and
went
to
tell
my
father
that
he
had
the
pleasure
of
a
daughter
.

It
was
what
Jove
had
said
a
few
months
ago
when
he
had
been
holding
my
wrist
,
too
tightly
,
across
a
restaurant
table
.

She
was
still
holding
my
hand
and
what
I
did
was
outside
of
anything
I
had
imagined
I
would
do
.

I
leaned
across
the
narrow
table
and
kissed
her
.

My
head
was
engaged
and
I
was
pushing
out
of
my
mother
's
chthonic
underworld
into
my
father
's
world
of
difficulty
and
dream
.

I
never
expected
to
go
back
down
again
.

When
she
ate
her
scones
she
left
a
snail-trail
of
soot
along
her
upper
lip
.

Her
neighbour
called
her
'
Blackmouth
'
.

My
grandmother
called
her
neighbour
'
Stinkpad
'
but
otherwise
they
were
friendly
,
exchanging
handkerchiefs
and
soap
at
Christmas
.

Cowardice
bedshares
with
arrogance
.

I
was
afraid
and
I
wanted
to
bluff
my
way
out
.

The
kiss
was
a
smoke
bomb
to
cause
confusion
and
distract
attention
.

I
thought
she
might
slap
me
.

I
thought
she
would
rush
away
.

In
fact
she
did
nothing
.

Asked
her
question
and
did
nothing
.

I
started
to
re-eat
my
cold
pasta
.

I
would
have
been
glad
to
climb
into
the
plate
and
cover
myself
in
clam
sauce
.

I
was
at
the
age
of
making
lists
but
the
lists
I
made
were
correspondences
,
half
true
and
altogether
fanciful
,
of
the
earth
the
sea
and
the
sky
.

Perhaps
I
was
trying
to
hold
together
my
own
world
that
was
in
so
much
danger
of
falling
away
.

Perhaps
I
wanted
order
where
there
was
none
.

As
the
QE2
floated
so
confidently
on
the
waters
I
thought
of
the
Titanic
,
ghostly
and
abandoned
beneath
,
and
somewhere
above
,
in
the
secretive
blackness
,
the
Ship
of
Fools
navigating
the
stars
.

Was
it
the
comet
?

Accordingly
,
my
father
put
on
his
Jolly
Jack
Tars
and
my
mother
wrapped
herself
up
in
her
mink
coat
.

In
those
days
their
car
was
a
three-litre
Rover
,
really
,
a
leather
three-piece
suite
and
cocktail
cabinet
on
wheels
.

My
father
purred
down
to
the
docks
looking
like
a
criminal
,
while
my
mother
fixed
herself
a
strictly
forbidden
gin
and
tonic
in
the
back
.

When
Stella
kissed
me
I
remember
thinking
,
'
This
is
not
allowed
.
'

I
was
glad
of
the
fog
and
the
dark
because
I
knew
that
if
anyone
saw
us
,
the
totality
of
our
lives
;
history
,
complexity
,
nationality
,
intelligence
,
age
,
achievement
,
status
,
would
be
shrunk
up
to
the
assumptions
of
our
kiss
.

Whoever
saw
us
would
say
,
'
There
's
a
couple
of
...
'
,
and
this
kiss
,
tentative
,
ambivalent
,
would
become
a
lock
and
key
.

'
David
,
'
she
said
.

She
was
wearing
a
black
oilskin
that
had
been
her
husband
's
.

It
hung
on
her
from
head
to
foot
,
so
much
so
that
she
seemed
less
to
be
wearing
a
rainproof
than
to
be
in
the
grip
of
a
monster
from
the
Deep
.

She
and
I
would
be
approaching
the
place
from
opposite
ends
of
town
.

I
imagined
her
,
angry
,
confident
,
ready
to
match
me
and
beat
me
at
my
own
game
.

This
was
the
big
fight
and
Jove
the
prize
.

When
I
told
him
she
had
written
to
me
he
had
decided
to
visit
friends
for
the
weekend
.

At
the
same
time
I
realised
that
I
would
like
to
do
much
more
kissing
if
it
were
not
so
complicated
.

So
complicated
.

My
first
serious
emotion
was
for
a
married
man
.

My
first
experience
of
authentic
desire
was
with
a
married
woman
.

You
see
,
I
did
want
to
kiss
her
.

That
was
what
surprised
me
most
of
all
.

As
he
gossiped
and
lounged
the
noise
of
the
Remington
stopped
.

His
secretary
came
out
from
the
low
line
of
offices
that
huddled
to
the
waterfront
.

There
was
an
urgent
call
for
him
.

Would
he
step
inside
at
once
?

My
father
loved
the
sea
and
should
have
been
an
active
seaman
but
there
were
more
opportunities
indoors
for
a
bright
boy
who
had
a
way
about
him
.

He
compensated
by
wheedling
his
way
onto
the
tugs
,
and
because
there
was
still
an
apprenticeship
mentality
about
the
Company
,
his
oddity
was
tolerated
.

What
harm
could
it
do
and
was
n't
all
experience
useful
?

Besides
,
he
did
it
in
his
own
time
and
it
made
him
popular
with
the
men
.

Meanwhile
,
in
a
maze
of
soggy
sheets
and
copies
of
Woman
's
Weekly
,
my
father
speared
my
mother
on
his
manhood
.

It
was
a
shining
morning
,
he
was
leaning
on
the
harbourside
rail
,
watching
the
cranes
load
the
ships
.

The
world
poured
through
his
fingers
;
spices
,
wine
,
tea
,
green
bananas
,
coconuts
,
American
golf
clubs
,
blankets
made
of
wool
with
satin
hemmed
round
the
edges
.

Today
they
were
loading
nylon
stockings
,
Monroe
look-alikes
stamped
all
over
the
cardboard
boxes
.

'
I
came
here
to
meet
...
'

He
had
risen
in
the
world
and
now
he
was
going
to
prove
it
.

On
board
my
grandmother
unpacked
her
carpet
bag
.

She
set
out
a
pile
of
clean
rags
,
the
ones
she
used
for
polishing
the
brass
plaques
,
a
bottle
of
cooking
brandy
,
a
bottle
of
iodine
,
a
primus
stove
,
a
cylinder
of
water
,
a
kitchen
knife
,
a
packet
of
sandwiches
,
a
little
blanket
from
the
dog
's
box
,
her
spectacles
and
the
Bible
,
now
open
towards
the
end
of
the
Psalms
.

This
done
,
she
took
off
her
oilskin
and
pegged
it
over
the
hatch
.

I
had
her
letter
in
my
pocket
.

The
careful
handwriting
.

The
instruction
to
obey
.

'
I
will
meet
you
on
Wednesday
the
12th
at
6:30
p.m.
in
the
bar
at
the
Algonquin
Hotel
.
'

He
knew
the
gangmen
and
the
loaders
and
the
truck
drivers
and
the
harbour
pilots
,
and
as
he
leaned
on
his
rail
,
watching
,
sometimes
waving
,
other
men
joined
him
,
lit
a
cigarette
,
told
him
the
news
and
with
a
slap
on
the
back
,
moved
on
.

The
easy
fraternity
of
working
men
was
comfortable
to
him
.

No
one
here
asked
him
what
school
he
had
attended
.

'
Is
something
wrong
?
'
said
my
father
.

My
father
used
to
tell
me
I
had
an
octopus-complex
.

'
Must
you
try
and
do
eight
things
at
once
?
'

I
used
to
imagine
that
there
was
an
octopus
,
hooded
,
ancient
,
floating
in
the
limp
waters
of
my
body
,
reaching
out
,
dark
and
blind
,
using
the
tentacles
to
probe
what
stood
outside
it
.

Analogies
fail
,
but
I
am
capable
of
behaving
like
an
eight-armed
cephalopod
while
protesting
the
innocence
of
my
two
hands
on
the
table
.

His
father
,
my
grandfather
,
was
killed
in
a
war
farce
when
an
American
torpedo
scuppered
the
wrong
boat
.

As
a
result
,
my
grandmother
was
paid
a
sizeable
pension
and
was
able
to
have
her
wild
strong
son
privately
educated
.

She
poured
her
money
into
him
as
though
he
were
a
treasure
chest
.

He
learned
well
,
looked
well
,
and
if
anyone
questioned
him
about
his
Mersey
terrace
two
up
two
down
he
simply
knocked
them
out
.

Throughout
his
life
my
father
has
dealt
with
difficult
questions
by
knocking
them
out
.

What
is
unconscious
does
not
speak
and
that
included
the
hidden
part
of
himself
.

She
had
been
well
educated
and
taught
to
conceal
it
.

She
never
gave
up
singing
and
playing
the
piano
and
she
never
gave
up
her
watercolours
.

The
rest
of
the
mind
she
disposed
of
at
marriage
and
did
not
think
to
ask
my
father
what
he
had
done
with
it
.

Why
had
she
chosen
here
?

Here
it
was
.

Five
minutes
to
spare
.

The
cruelty
of
time
.

Did
I
say
that
?

No
she
did
.

I
sometimes
think
my
personality
is
a
troopship
's
atoll
;
invade
me
.

And
so
the
three
of
them
climbed
aboard
the
Godspeed
and
chugged
into
the
dark
.

When
I
was
born
the
waters
were
still
alive
.

My
father
too
,
was
still
alive
,
strong
and
burly
,
as
wide
as
he
was
tall
,
with
an
enormous
chest
that
looked
as
though
it
could
tow
the
cargo
boats
itself
.

We
cooked
breakfast
in
the
remains
of
the
frying
pan
and
ate
our
food
standing
up
,
looking
out
of
the
window
over
to
the
park
.

Yes
,
Mr
Evans
,
I
feel
an
initiative
of
the
type
you
have
just
suggested
would
be
entirely
appropriate
.

I
would
ask
that
they
reconsider
,
since
this
is
not
the
case
.

Transport
safety
has
sadly
been
in
the
news
recently
:

Needless
to
say
,
safety
on
roads
,
railways
and
inland
waterways
is
of
key
importance
and
,
given
the
international
nature
of
these
types
of
transport
,
training
for
safety
advisors
should
also
be
harmonised
,
therefore
,
as
well
as
the
requirements
of
the
new
ADR
,
for
example
,
which
is
under
way
.

This
is
not
just
the
fault
of
the
Commission
,
but
I
believe
that
we
need
to
take
action
more
quickly
so
as
to
achieve
harmonisation
in
this
area
as
well
.

I
can
live
with
these
minimum
standards
,
but
I
would
ask
the
Commission
to
monitor
the
situation
very
carefully
.

But
I
believe
that
we
should
do
all
we
can
to
keep
the
transport
of
dangerous
goods
to
a
minimum
,
in
all
countries
,
whether
they
are
transit
countries
or
not
.

I
hope
my
proposal
will
be
taken
into
consideration
in
tomorrow
's
vote
.

I
would
like
to
ask
the
Vice
-
President
if
she
is
in
a
position
to
tell
us
today
what
the
state
of
play
is
with
regard
to
the
efforts
towards
harmonisation
being
made
by
these
two
organisations
,
and
whether
the
EU
is
in
a
position
to
hasten
these
harmonisation
efforts
,
in
accordance
with
principles
that
are
as
simple
as
possible
.

Mr
President
,
I
would
very
much
like
to
thank
Mrs
Schroedter
for
the
work
she
has
done
on
this
and
to
explain
to
colleagues
that
I
am
speaking
for
my
colleague
,
Mrs
Flautre
,
who
followed
this
for
the
Committee
on
Employment
and
Social
Affairs
but
who
is
unfortunately
ill
.

But
the
lack
of
specific
guidelines
here
is
particularly
to
be
regretted
,
as
the
idea
of
linking
Social
Fund
assistance
to
the
employment
strategy
will
be
put
into
effect
for
the
first
time
during
the
2000
-
2006
programme
.

The
truth
of
the
matter
though
is
that
we
believe
-
and
this
is
also
shown
in
the
way
the
conclusions
have
been
drafted
-
that
the
Commission
must
take
account
of
what
is
adopted
by
this
Parliament
,
particularly
in
the
face
of
an
interim
revision
of
these
Directives
.

Mr
President
,
Commissioner
,
I
would
like
to
thank
Mrs
Schroedter
for
an
excellent
report
.

She
has
gone
into
the
issue
in
some
depth
and
in
the
committee
debate
she
took
account
of
many
of
the
amendments
that
have
been
tabled
regarding
this
report
.

It
contained
details
and
issues
that
had
already
been
raised
in
previous
reports
.

This
has
been
an
ongoing
concern
for
the
five
years
that
I
have
been
a
Member
of
this
Parliament
,
and
I
have
raised
the
issue
time
and
time
again
.

Consequently
,
I
feel
we
must
look
to
the
future
and
establish
guidelines
for
the
mid
-
term
review
in
2003
,
and
thus
have
an
influence
on
the
second
phase
of
programming
set
to
follow
2003
.

Its
implementation
would
certainly
require
extending
the
scope
of
redistribution
instruments
such
as
the
Structural
Funds
.

Mr
President
,
I
too
would
like
to
congratulate
the
rapporteur
on
her
excellent
work
.

I
will
conclude
,
Mr
President
,
by
saying
that
the
failure
of
the
Commission
's
communication
to
focus
on
territorial
pacts
and
,
especially
,
methods
of
combating
unemployment
among
women
and
young
people
,
is
cause
for
serious
concern
.

and
Romania

the
European

.

Bulgaria
and
Romania
accede
to
the
decisions
and
agreements
adopted
by
the
Representatives
of
the
Governments
of
the
Member
States
meeting
within
the
Council
.

The

The
Council
shall
act
unanimously
after
consulting
the
European
Parliament
.

The
application
of
the

,
be
subject
to
the
derogations
provided
for

this
Protocol
.

Notwithstanding
this
,
public
procurement
procedures
initiated
after
accession
shall
be
carried
out
in
accordance
with
the
relevant
Union
provisions
.

The
last
programming
exercise
for
the
pre
-
accession
assistance
referred
to
in
paragraph

shall
take
place
in
the
last
year
preceding
accession
.

Actions
under
these
programmes
will
have
to
be
contracted
within
the
following
two
years
.

No
extensions
shall
be
granted
for
the
contracting
period
.

Exceptionally
and
in
duly

cases
,
limited
extensions
in
terms
of
duration
may
be
granted
for
execution
of
contracts
.

For
audit
and
evaluation
costs
,
pre
-
accession
funds
may
be
committed
up
to
five
years
after
accession
.

However
,
the
provisions
contained
in
Article
165
of
the
Financial
Regulation
applicable
to
the
general
budget
of
the
European
Communities
shall
not
apply
.

The
Commission
may
adopt
rules
for
implementation
of
the
assistance
referred
to
in
paragraph
2
.

To
this
end
,
the
Commission
shall
be
assisted
by
a
committee
.

The
committee
shall
adopt
its
rules
of
procedure
.

This
assistance
shall
fund
institution
-
building
projects
and
limited
small-scale
investments
ancillary
thereto
.

The
appropriations
shall
be
authorised
by
the
budgetary
authority
within
the
limits
of
the
financial
perspective
.

One
twelfth
of
each
annual
amount
shall
be
payable
to
Bulgaria
and
Romania
on
the
first
working
day
of
each
month
in
the
corresponding
year
.

The
lump
-
sum
payments
shall
be
used
within
three
years
from
the
first
payment
.

Any
unused
or
unjustifiably
spent
funds
shall
be
recovered
by
the
Commission
.

The
Commission
may
adopt
any
technical
provisions
necessary
for
the
operation
of
the
temporary
Cash
-
flow
and
Schengen
Facility
.

The
measures
thus
decided
on
shall
be
applicable
forthwith
,
shall
take
account
of
the
interest
of
all
parties
concerned
and
shall
not
entail
frontier
controls
.

Priority
shall
be
given
to
such
measures
as
will
least
disturb
the
functioning
of
the
internal
market
.

Such
safeguard
measures
shall
not
be
invoked
as
a
means
of
arbitrary
discrimination
or
a
disguised
restriction
on
trade
between
Member
States
.

The
measures
shall
be
maintained
no
longer
than
strictly
necessary
and
,
in
any
case
,
shall
be
lifted
when
the
relevant
commitment
is
implemented
.

They
may
however
be
applied
beyond
the
period
specified
in
the
first
paragraph
as
long
as
the
relevant
commitments
have
not
been
fulfilled
.

In
response
to
progress
made
by
the
new
Member
State
concerned
in
fulfilling
its
commitments
,
the
Commission
may
adapt
the
measures
as
appropriate
.

The
measures
shall
be
maintained
no
longer
than
strictly
necessary
and
,
in
any
case
,
shall
be
lifted
when
the
shortcomings
are
remedied
.

They
may
however
be
applied
beyond
the
period
specified
in
the
first
paragraph
as
long
as
these
shortcomings
persist
.

A
European
law
of
the
Council
may
extend
this
period
.

These
measures
shall
be
taken
during
a
period
of
three
years
following
the
date
of
accession
and
their
application
shall
be
limited
to
that
period

are
rendered
necessary

The
Rules

shall
require
the
consent
of
the
Council
.

A
national
of
each
new
Member
State
shall
be
appointed
to
the
Court
of
Auditors
as
from
the
date
of
accession
for
a
term
of
office
of
six
years
.

The
terms
of
office
of
the
members
thus

shall
expire
at
the
same
time
as
those
of
the
members
in
office
at
the
time

.

The
terms

at
the
time
of
accession
.

They
shall
communicate
those
measures
to
the
Commission
by
the
date
of
accession
or
,
where
later
,
by
the
time
limit
provided
for
in
this
Protocol
.

The
measures
shall
be
adopted
according
to
the
voting
rules
governing
the

the
act

as
from
the
date
of
accession
.

Where
these
adaptations
are
adopted
after
accession
they
may
be
applied
as
from
the
date
of
accession
.

They
shall
be
published
in
the
Official
Journal
of
the
European
Union
if
the
texts
in
the
present
languages
were
so
published
.

Annexes
I
to
IX
and
the
Appendices
thereto
shall
form
an
integral
part
of
this
Protocol
.

The
text
of
that
Treaty
,
drawn
up
in
the
Bulgarian
and
Romanian
languages
,
shall
be
annexed
to
this
Protocol
.

Those
texts
shall
be
authentic
under
the
same
conditions
as
the
texts
of
the
Treaty
referred
to
in
the
first
paragraph
,
drawn
up
in
the
present
languages
.

As
long
as
this
Agreement
is
not
yet
concluded
,
insofar
as
it
applies
provisionally
.

A
national
base
area
for
each
producing
Member
State
is
hereby
established
.

However
,
for
France
two
base
areas
are
established
.

A
maximum
guaranteed
area
of
829229
ha
is
hereby
established
.

If
such
a
decision
is
taken
before
the
date
of
accession
,
the
decision
will
only
come
into
effect
upon
the
date
of
accession
.

the
aid
measures
shall
be
communicated
to
the
Commission
within
four
months
of
the
date
of
accession
.

This
communication
shall
include
information
on
the
legal
basis
for
each
measure
.

After
that
date
,
any
aid
found
to
be
incompatible
with
those
guidelines
shall
be
considered
as
new
aid
.

The
stocks
referred
to
in
paragraph
1
shall
be
deducted
from
the
quantity
exceeding
the
normal
carryover
of
stocks
.

Such
companies
bring
technologically
advanced
imports
and
new
management
techniques
that
foster
growth
in
domestic
firms
,
while
spurring
industrial
modernization
.

Medicine
,
however
affordable
,
is
of
no
value
if
no
one
is
available
to
prescribe
or
administer
it
.

Here
,
too
,
Germany
should
take
the
lead
.

And
China
relied
heavily
on
the
US
dollar
to
anchor
its
undervalued
currency
,
allowing
it
to
boost
its
export
competitiveness
.

In
the
end
,
however
,
this
codependency
was
a
marriage
of
convenience
,
not
of
love
.

If
America
remains
stuck
in
its
under
-
saving
ways
but
finds
itself
without
Chinese
goods
and
capital
,
it
will
suffer
higher
inflation
,
rising
interest
rates
,
and
a
weaker
dollar
.

Though
the
likely
answer
is
yes
,
the
downside
risks
seem
higher
than
they
did
a
few
decades
ago
.

All
of
these
problems
have
solutions
,
at
least
in
the
short
to
medium
run
.

Or
perhaps
this
innovation
is
less
significant
than
its
enthusiasts
believe
.

It
is
telling
that
most
of
the
symposium
's
47
participants
–
influential
public
-
and
private
-
sector
figures
from
around
the
world
–
were
unaware
of
the
extent
to
which
a
mother
's
nutrition
affects
her
offspring
's
wellbeing
.

This
reflects
a
fundamental
failing
on
the
part
of
the
scientific
community
to
relay
relevant
data
to
decision
-
makers
.

In
South
Korea
,
Japan
,
and
elsewhere
,
developing
and
maximizing
women
's
potential
will
require
comprehensive
education
and
labor
-
market
reforms
,
as
well
as
structural
change
,
particularly
on
the
services
side
of
the
economy
.

In
the
realm
of
international
economics
,
being
perceived
as
boring
confers
power
to
the
extent
that
it
allows
major
decisions
to
be
made
without
a
great
deal
of
external
scrutiny
.

Nothing
good
would
ever
happen
–
and
certainly
not
for
the
US
.

These
countries
'
global
economic
and
financial
significance
has
grown
rapidly
,
yet
they
have
relatively
little
representation
at
the
Fund
.

A
package
of
reforms
has
been
agreed
.

In
effect
,
the
administration
tried
to
make
the
IMF
more
interesting
,
particularly
to
encourage
Republicans
in
the
House
of
Representatives
to
support
the
reforms
.

The
latest
indications
are
that
the
Republicans
will
not
be
so
enticed
.

Not
an
inch
.

And
yet
,
as
Ukrainians
work
to
rebuild
our
country
after
Viktor
Yanukovych
's
predatory
rule
,
we
are
facing
a
new
threat
,
in
the
form
of
a
"
peace
offensive
"
–
that
old
staple
of
Soviet
diplomacy
designed
to
undermine
Western
resolve
.

If
there
is
no
oppression
of
Russian
speakers
in
Ukraine
,
there
is
no
reason
to
change
the
country
's
political
structure
.

When
it
comes
to
genetic
engineering
,
however
,
science
seems
to
matter
less
than
politics
.

After
all
,
establishing
a
genuine
fiscal
union
would
require
strong
political
commitment
–
and
considerable
legwork
.

His
time
at
Vendôme
is
reflected
in
Louis
Lambert
,
his
1832
novel
about
a
young
boy
studying
at
an
Oratorian
grammar
school
at
Vendôme
.

as
Robb
explained
:

A
symbolic
inheritance
.

In
the
end
,
his
health
fails
and
he
is
consumed
by
his
own
confusion
.

Their
length
was
not
predetermined
.

His
preferred
method
was
to
eat
a
light
meal
at
five
or
six
in
the
afternoon
,
then
sleep
until
midnight
.

Although
Balzac
was
"
by
turns
a
hermit
and
a
vagrant
"
,
he
managed
to
stay
connected
to
the
social
world
which
nourished
his
writing
.

His
health
deteriorated
on
the
way
,
and
Ewelina
wrote
to
her
daughter
about
Balzac
being
"
in
a
state
of
extreme
weakness
"
and
"
sweating
profusely
"
.

Balzac
sought
to
present
his
characters
as
real
people
,
neither
fully
good
nor
fully
evil
,
but
fully
human
.

As
he
did
with
the
people
around
him
,
Balzac
studied
these
places
in
depth
,
traveling
to
remote
locations
and
surveying
notes
that
he
had
made
on
previous
visits
.

"
The
artist
of
the
Comédie
Humaine
,
"
he
wrote
,
"
is
half
smothered
by
the
historian
.

"
Balzac
has
received
high
praise
from
critics
as
diverse
as
Walter
Benjamin
and
Camille
Paglia
.

It
is
not
known
exactly
when
Shakespeare
began
writing
,
but
contemporary
allusions
and
records
of
performances
show
that
several
of
his
plays
were
on
the
London
stage
by
1592
.

Shakespeare
was
buried
in
the
chancel
of
the
Holy
Trinity
Church
two
days
after
his
death
.

The
epitaph
carved
into
the
stone
slab
covering
his
grave
includes
a
curse
against
moving
his
bones
,
which
was
carefully
avoided
during
restoration
of
the
church
in
2008
.

Shakespeare
collaborated
on
two
further
surviving
plays
,
Henry
VIII
and
The
Two
Noble
Kinsmen
,
probably
with
John
Fletcher
.

After
Hamlet
,
Shakespeare
varied
his
poetic
style
further
,
particularly
in
the
more
emotional
passages
of
the
late
tragedies
.

In
Shakespeare
's
late
romances
,
he
deliberately
returned
to
a
more
artificial
style
,
which
emphasised
the
illusion
of
theatre
.

In
the
18
th
and
19
th
centuries
,
his
reputation
also
spread
abroad
.

Only
a
small
minority
of
academics
believe
there
is
reason
to
question
the
traditional
attribution
,
but
interest
in
the
subject
,
particularly
the
Oxfordian
theory
of
Shakespeare
authorship
,
continues
into
the
21
st
century
.

“
While
much
of
the
digital
transition
is
unprecedented
in
the
United
States
,
the
peaceful
transition
of
power
is
not
,
”
Obama
special
assistant
Kori
Schulman
wrote
in
a
blog
post
Monday
.

For
those
who
follow
social
media
transitions
on
Capitol
Hill
,
this
will
be
a
little
different
.

But
in
a
break
from
his
past
rhetoric
about
curtailing
immigration
,
the
GOP
nominee
proclaimed
that
as
president
he
would
allow
“
tremendous
numbers
”
of
legal
immigrants
based
on
a
“
merit
system
.
”

“
So
I
hate
to
put
a
little
pressure
on
you
,
but
the
fate
of
the
republic
rests
on
your
shoulders
,
”
he
told
the
crowd
gathered
on
a
sports
field
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
.

The
new
spending
is
fueled
by
Clinton
’s
large
bank
account
.

What
she
’s
saying
and
what
she
’s
doing
,
it
—
actually
,
it
’s
unbelievable
.

$
5,000
per
person
,
the
maximum
allowed
.

In
early
October
,
the
transition
team
used
the
same
venue
to
meet
with
technology
lobbyists
,
inviting
representatives
from
Uber
,
the
Motion
Picture
Association
of
America
,
the
Consumer
Technology
Association
and
other
groups
.

The
gathering
was
originally
slated
for
Washington
’s
private
Metropolitan
Club
on
H
Street
a
few
blocks
away
.

Maybe
the
dress
code
was
too
stuffy
.

Rather
than
teaching
the
scientific
method
as
a
separate
unit
,
for
example
,
students
learn
science
content
by
applying
it
.

They
are
at
the
national
average
in
grade
4
and
better
than
national
average
in
grade
8
.

By
comparison
,
it
cost
$
103.7
million
to
build
the
NoMa
infill
Metro
station
,
which
opened
in
2004
.

“
We
face
a
lot
of
competition
,
and
we
think
transit
can
help
,
”
said
Joe
Sternlieb
,
president
of
the
Georgetown
BID
.

The
feasibility
study
estimates
that
it
would
take
passengers
about
four
minutes
to
cross
the
Potomac
River
on
the
gondola
.

A
witness
told
police
that
the
victim
had
attacked
the
suspect
in
April
.

There
are
parallels
to
draw
here
between
games
and
our
everyday
lives
.

That
share
has
been
rising
steadily
over
the
years
—
only
11
percent
of
the
total
vote
was
cast
before
Election
Day
in
1996
,
according
to
the
Census
Bureau
--
and
seems
likely
to
jump
again
this
year
.

Today
,
Khanzir
may
be
a
lonely
pig
,
but
he
is
n’t
always
alone
.

“
We
’ve
requested
other
nations
to
help
us
populate
the
zoo
with
different
species
of
animals
,
including
a
pig
,
”
Saqib
said
.

There
was
a
time
,
Mr
Panvalkar
said
,
when
he
felt
that
they
should
leave
the
building
.

She
has
also
been
charged
with
trying
to
kill
her
two
-
year
-
old
daughter
.

She
killed
Andre
Price
III
by
pressing
his
face
into
an
air
mattress
in
her
sitting
room
before
trying
to
do
the
same
to
her
daughter
,
Angel
,
police
said
.

"
I
'm
going
to
jail
either
way
,
hope
it
was
worth
it
.
"

First
one
of
the
Yazidi
women
started
crying
,
then
one
of
her
friends
.

Mr
Osborne
signed
up
with
a
US
speakers
agency
after
being
sacked
in
July
.

Michael
Fallon
said
the
date
for
cutting
the
first
steel
would
help
secure
new
investment
and
safeguard
hundreds
of
skilled
jobs
until
2035
.

The
promise
of
new
Royal
Navy
orders
to
secure
the
Clyde
shipbuilding
industry
was
made
before
the
Scottish
independence
referendum
in
2014
.

It
's
most
obvious
when
a
celebrity
's
name
is
initially
quite
rare
.

And
by
2007
,
at
the
height
of
its
popularity
(
and
,
perhaps
,
Knightley
's
)
it
was
a
top
50
name
,
with
three
times
more
babies
named
Keira
than
Kiera
.

The
South
Korean
company
initially
thought
a
battery
fault
was
to
blame
,
and
switched
its
own
component
for
a
third
-
party
power
cell
.

Several
analysts
have
suggested
Huawei
is
best
placed
to
benefit
from
Samsung
's
setback
.

The
Mate
9
phones
lack
an
artificial
intelligence
interface
,
like
the
Google
Assistant
or
Apple
's
Siri
.

But
one
travel
expert
warned
in
-
flight
internet
was
often
unreliable
and
was
unlikely
to
influence
travellers
'
airline
choices
.

"
But
it
may
be
that
BA
and
IAG
have
cracked
it
and
can
offer
something
vaguely
reliable
.
"

The
company
told
the
BBC
it
would
be
the
responsibility
of
each
airline
brand
to
decide
whether
to
charge
passengers
an
access
fee
.

"
Most
people
would
find
airport
wi-fi
more
useful
than
being
able
to
send
emails
on
a
plane
.
"

It
's
like
a
super
power
sometimes
.

The
scheme
makes
money
through
sponsorship
and
advertising
.

The
10
-
week
course
has
been
"
certified
"
by
UK
spy
agency
GCHQ
.

But
some
security
experts
raised
questions
about
the
need
for
the
course
and
the
intent
behind
it
.

Previously
the
jets
had
only
been
seen
by
bloggers
.

Naturally
China
will
be
presenting
plenty
of
other
military
hardware
this
week
from
attack
helicopters
to
seaplanes
.

And
with
China
set
to
become
the
world
's
biggest
aviation
market
in
the
next
decade
,
the
show
is
an
opportunity
for
Beijing
to
demonstrate
its
ambitions
in
civil
aviation
as
well
as
defence
.

"
Unfortunately
once
again
the
few
ruin
it
for
the
many
,
"
wrote
Jesse
LaBrocca
,
founder
of
Hack
Forums
,
in
a
message
explaining
why
the
section
was
being
closed
.

The
"
recent
events
"
are
likely
to
be
the
attacks
of
21
October
that
briefly
took
down
popular
websites
such
as
Reddit
,
Twitter
and
Spotify
as
well
as
many
others
.

Analysis
revealed
that
historic
amounts
of
data
had
been
used
to
cause
the
disruption
.

A
UN
review
of
national
plans
to
cut
carbon
says
they
are
well
short
of
the
levels
needed
to
keep
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
under
2C
.

Many
scientists
say
that
technology
to
remove
carbon
from
the
air
will
now
be
needed
to
meet
the
Paris
targets
.

"
We
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
:
the
Paris
Agreement
will
slow
climate
change
,
as
will
the
recent
Kigali
Amendment
to
reduce
HFCs
,
"
said
Erik
Solheim
,
head
of
UN
Environment
.

Investments
in
this
area
were
up
by
6
%
in
2015
to
$
221bn
.

It
's
fantastic
that
they
got
the
Paris
Agreement
but
their
contributions
at
the
moment
are
nowhere
near
the
1.5
-
degree
target
.

It
was
conducted
just
off
the
Mexican
coast
from
April
to
June
.

This
will
put
new
limits
on
the
nature
of
the
environmental
changes
that
overtook
the
Earth
and
sent
so
many
species
-
not
just
the
dinosaurs
-
into
oblivion
.

A
telltale
of
this
meteoritic
material
will
likely
be
high
levels
of
the
element
iridium
.

Just
over
70
%
of
the
plants
grown
from
Earth
seeds
were
alive
after
17
days
-
just
slightly
more
than
the
plants
grown
from
space
seeds
-
just
over
66
%
.

The
results
from
this
experiment
provides
further
support
that
rocket
seeds
can
be
flown
and
stored
on
the
International
Space
Station
for
six
months
without
having
any
significant
impacts
on
their
ability
to
germinate
and
grow
on
Earth
.

The
RHS
collected
comments
sent
in
by
schoolchildren
and
teachers
involved
in
the
experiment
.

"
There
is
still
a
'
yuk
'
factor
to
the
whole
idea
of
buying
and
wearing
other
people
's
body
parts
,
"
she
says
.

In
China
the
hair
is
typically
put
in
a
chemical
bath
to
remove
the
cuticle
completely
,
Tarlo
explains
.

Throughout
history
,
the
international
hair
market
has
always
had
a

"
Tonight
we
are
carrying
out
punishments
using
a
high
beam

"
the
post
reads
.

Shenzhen
's
traffic
police
have
opted
for
unconventional
penalties
before
.

Who
are
they
?

Much
of
the
debate
,
from
the
Democratic
side
this
year
,
has
been
about
white
male
identity
.

I
asked
her
afterwards
if
she
understood
why
people
might
vote
for
Trump
.

Not
everyone
can
rise
above
it
.

"
Luckily
,
someone
in
Sony
Australia
was

'
Hey

did
you

this
?

says

.

Seagal
made
headlines
when
he
described
Russia
's
actions
in
Crimea
,
which
it
annexed
in
2014
,
as
"
very
reasonable
"
.

A
keen
guitarist
,
he
played
a
concert
there
the
same
year
.

Seagal
,
whose
grandmother
was
from
Vladivostok
in
Russia
's
far
east
,
has
made
frequent
trips
to
Russia
in
recent
years
and
visited
Kamchatka
and
Sakhalin
in
September
.

Earlier
this
year
Seagal
was
given
Serbian
nationality
after
offering
to
set
up
a
martial
arts
school
in
the
capital
Belgrade
.

A
police
spokesman
told
the
Associated
Press
there
was
"
an
exchange
of
words
"
followed
by
an
"
altercation
"
but
that
no
injuries
had
been
reported
.

Cuaron
,
whose
last
film
was
the
Oscar
-
winning
Gravity
,
was
reportedly
not
on
set
at
the
time
of
the
incident
.

According
to
the
city
's
police
department
,
a
fight
broke
out
after
"
a
large
group
of
people
...
who
identified
themselves
as
district
authorities
"
arrived
on
set
on
Tuesday
.

Researchers
have
been
investigating
potential
for
male
hormonal
contraceptives
for
around
20
years
.

He
added
:
"
This
has
been
one
step
in
a
long
journey
of
finding
the
right
combination
for
male
hormonal
contraception
.
"

However
there
are
many
MLAs
with
deeply
-
held
religious
beliefs
who
oppose
any
new
legislation
.

Researchers
say
analysing
tumour
DNA
may
help
explain
the
underlying
causes
of
other
cancers
.

The
analysis
shows
a
direct
link
between
the
number
of
cigarettes
smoked
in
a
lifetime
and
the
number
of
mutations
in
tumour
DNA
.

However
,
they
could
not
find
this
same
pattern
in
tissues
such
as
the
bladder
,
which
are
not
directly
exposed
.

Ms
Pugh
has
received
treatment
at
Papworth
and
Addenbrooke
's
Hospitals
in
Cambridgeshire
.

But
a
scan
has
shown
the
tumour
in
Ms
Pugh
's
right
lung
is
growing
,
and
she
has
had
to
leave
the
trial
.

"
If
Donald
Trump
becomes
president
,
the
government
here
will
still
have
to
work
with
him
to
advance
whatever
shared
agenda
there
is
,
to
ensure
that
Canadian
businesses
and
interests
are
represented
in
Washington
.
"

Trudeau
will
extend
that
invitation
to
the
45th
president
of
the
United
States
,
whoever
he
or
she
may
be
.

Despite
the
release
of
a
photo
this
morning
,
police
in
B.C.
say
they
have
more
questions
than
answers
about
an
apparently
homeless
man
charged
in
the
fatal
stabbing
of
a
teen
girl
at
her
Abbotsford
high
school
.

Police
in
B.C.
said
earlier
Klein
did
not
appear
to
have
a
criminal
history
and
released
vague
details
about
his
recent
whereabouts
.

"
We
do
not
believe
the
suspect
has
ties
to
this
school
,
or
to
the
two
girls
,
or
specifically
to
the
Abbotsford
area
,
"
she
said
.

He
also
said
Klein
was
uncommunicative
,
uncooperative
and
unwilling
to
walk
up
from
cells
under
the
courthouse
to
attend
his
hearing
.

The
association
that
represents
real
estate
agents
in
Ontario
says
more
needs
to
be
done
to
protect
consumers
and
punish
agents
found
to
have
engaged
in
unethical
behaviour
.

He
'd
also
like
to
see
greater
enforcement
and
investigative
powers
for
the
Real
Estate
Council
of
Ontario
(
RECO
)
,
which
regulates
agents
in
the
province
.

Currently
,
the
maximum
fine
RECO
can
levy
against
an
agent
is
$
25,000
.

But
China
's
growing
middle
class
has
been
unusually
vocal
in
its
complaints
about
toxic
air
in
cities
like
Beijing
,
which
can
see
day
after
day
of
lung
-
choking
smog
.

"
We
are
seeing
many
,
many
countries
and
especially
large
new
emitters
like
Brazil
,
South
Africa
,
India
and
China
stepping
up
to
the
plate
in
terms
of
playing
a
role
in
reducing
emissions
,
"
said
Guilbeault
.

He
could
also
wait
until
the
end
of
his
first
term
to
use
a
provision
in
the
Paris
agreement
to
pull
out
of
the
pact
.

Clinton
and
allies
,
meanwhile
,
are
seeking
to
keep
the
spotlight
on
Trump
,
charging
that
his
disparaging
comments
about
women
and
minorities
,
and
his
temperament
make
him
unfit
for
office
.

That
's
not
what
we
need
in
our
country
,
folks
.

Trump
's
wife
,
Melania
Trump
,
made
her
first
appearance
on
the
trail
since
the
Republican
convention
in
July
.

Students
like
Rai
have
been
meeting
with
counsellors
at
the
school
to
talk
about
what
happened
,
but
she
said
the
biggest
comfort
has
come
from
seeing
her
friends
.

"
This
is
a
disaster
for
pain
patients
,
"
Mailis
said
in
an
interview
Thursday
with
CBC
News
.

"
Physicians
do
n't
have
these
tools
,
they
have
only
a
prescription
pad
and
an
injection
,
"
Mailis
said
.

The
Ontario
Independent
Police
Review
Director
,
Gerry
McNeilly
,
set
the
terms
for
his
review
this
week
after
"
alarming
questions
"
were
raised
about
how
officers
interact
with
Indigenous
peoples
.

The
review
is
also
investigating
inflammatory
Facebook
posts
from
September
,
alleged
to
come
from
police
officers
in
the
northern
Ontario
city
.

The
executives
also
received
so
-
called
"
performance
pay
"
for
succeeding
or
surpassing
expectations
,
sharing
a
pot
of
$
1.5
million
among
them
,
or
an
estimated
$
15,000
each
on
average
.

Its
annual
budget
is
more
than
$
1.4
billion
,
and
it
employs
more
than
6,000
people
.

The
federal
government
proactively
reports
on
aggregate
performance
pay
and
bonus
levels
for
each
department
,
but
the
latest
web
posting
is
for
2013
-
2014
—
or
two
years
out
of
date
.

The
total
for
performance
pay
and
bonus
that
year
was
$
1.5
million
,
about
the
same
level
as
for
2015
-
2016
.

Gomery
,
who
led
the
commission
of
inquiry
into
the
federal
sponsorship
scandal
between
2004
and
2006
,
said
such
bodies
are
essential
to
help
restore
public
confidence
in
the
rule
of
law
.

That
led
to
revelations
over
the
last
two
days
that
at
least
six
other
Quebec
journalists
were
targeted
by
provincial
police
surveillance
operations
.

"
There
should
be
no
preferential
access
to
government
,
or
appearance
of
preferential
access
,
accorded
to
individuals
or
organizations
because
they
have
made
financial
contributions
to
politicians
and
political
parties
,
"
the
guidelines
read
.

The
judge
in
Duffy
's
fraud
and
breach
of
trust
trial
ultimately
ruled
they
were
within
the
Senate
's
rules
when
he
cleared
Duffy
of
all
charges
.

Our
cellphones
are
so
much
more
than
phones
these
days
.

"
It
is
amazing
,
"
reported
SaskTel
unlimited
data
customer
Lindsay
Gay
last
month
.

He
also
pointed
out
that
Rogers
recently
introduced
a
new
app
tool
that
helps
customers
monitor
their
data
usage
.

That
's
what
keeps
us
coming
back
for
more
.

"
These
estimates
coincide
with
the
percentages
of
new
condos
entering
the
rental
market
upon
completion
,
indicating
the
important
role
(
domestic
)
investors
play
in
the
GTA
housing
market
.
"

"
This
strain
helps
with
back
pain
,
this
strain
helps
with
nausea
,
this
product
makes
you
sleep
at
night
,
"
says
Dietrich
from
the
company
's
headquarters
in
Denver
,
Colorado
,
where
pot
is
sold
legally
.

But
without
a
legislative
framework
,
and
with
the
grassroots
origins
of
pot
as
a
mood
-
altering
folk
remedy
,
companies
are
left
guessing
.

Iron
is
an
essential
element
the
body
requires
to
produce
hemoglobin
,
the
protein
found
in
red
blood
cells
that
's
responsible
for
transporting
oxygen
to
tissues
in
the
body
.

The
current
waiting
period
is
eight
weeks
.

It
's
possible
to
have
normal
hemoglobin
levels
,
but
to
have
low
iron
stores
overall
,
says
Canadian
Blood
Services
(
CBS
)
.

The
new
iron
guidelines
mean
more
donors
are
needed
.

What
started
as
a
routine
ultrasound
became
complicated
when
expectant
mother
Margaret
Boemer
,
of
Plano
,
Texas
,
was
told
her
unborn
child
had
a
rare
condition
and
needed
surgery
to
survive
.

A
sacrococcygeal
teratoma
is
a
tumour
that
develops
before
birth
and
grows
from
a
baby
's
tailbone
.

It
is
the
most
common
tumour
found
in
babies
,
occurring
in
one
of
every
35,000
births
.

She
was
84
years
old
.

He
described
her
as
a
"
remarkable
"
and
"
loving
and
wonderful
"
woman
who
left
her
mark
in
the
literary
world
with
her
stories
.

"
Some
men
get
it
and
Bono
is
one
of
those
guys
,
"
Leive
said
in
a
recent
interview
.

At
just
20
,
she
is
a
strong
voice
against
bullying
and
a
positive
one
in
helping
girls
embrace
their
own
standards
of
beauty
.

"
Her
voice
literally
went
around
the
world
,
"
Leive
said
.

As
soon
as
the
official
party
photos
were
released
,
social
media
lit
up
with
comments
—
and
they
were
less
than
favourable
.

Many
people
,
including
Indigenous
groups
,
argue
they
trivialize
First
Nations
culture
.

The
purpose
of
these
CRTC
hearings
is
to
field
responses
from
industry
stakeholders
and
the
public
.

This
would
not
only
apply
to
entertainment
content
,
but
equally
to
education
,
to
scientific
research
and
,
perhaps
most
importantly
,
to
political
discourse
.

After
all
,
the
internet
is
not
a
luxury
;
it
is
an
essential
tool
.

The
debris
formed
a
ring
around
the
Earth
's
equator
and
was
eventually
drawn
together
by
gravity
to
form
the
moon
.

Still
,
there
are
questions
left
unanswered
.

In
the
town
of
Hillsborough
,
just
outside
Chapel
Hill
,
someone
firebombed
the
Republican
Party
headquarters
last
month
.

After
North
Carolina
passed
its
restrictive
voting
-
rights
bill
in
2013
,
Campbell
went
around
to
churches
teaching
people
how
to
deal
with
challenges
to
their
registration
.

He
could
detect
the
effects
of
the
election
around
him
,
in
the
bursts
of
conflict
and
the
curious
intersection
of
new
ideas
with
old
ones
.

This
discordance
between
economic
data
and
political
rhetoric
is
familiar
,
or
should
be
.

Republican
economists
caution
against
taking
this
data
as
proof
that
their
party
is
lousy
at
economic
policy
.

“
I
do
n’t
know
what
G.D.P.
growth
was
during
the
Washington
and
Lincoln
Administrations
,
but
the
institutional
developments
in
those
terms
had
large
and
long
-
lasting
effects
.
”

There
are
more
differences
between
Sulla
and
Trump
,
Rome
and
the
U.S.
,
than
there
are
similarities
,
but
that
does
n’t
discredit
the
resemblances
.

And
,
she
granted
,
“
you
have
to
look
at
where
she
has
acknowledged
that
we
need
to
do
something
different
—
we
can
do
better
—
and
where
she
has
expressed
regret
.
”

But
,
as
the
criticism
of
Clinton
as
First
Lady
became
more
caustic
,
Karel
became
more
empathetic
.

“
When
I
’m
playing
him
,
I
feel
powerful
,
”
the
Donald
Trump
impersonator
John
Di
Domenico
explained
to
Slate
last
year
.

As
the
hysteria
of
the
2016
Presidential
election
intensifies
,
a
more
troubling
threat
than
bullshit
preoccupies
Karel
.

They
’re
usually
artists
who
want
to
do
a
bunch
of
stuff
.

Then
the
commercial
ends
.

Miami
Bass
producers
were
clinical
in
the
art
of
moving
butts
—
their
main
concern
.

In
a
recent
interview
,
Zay
and
Zayion
described
recording
their
version
of
“
Knuck
If
You
Buck
”
on
a
home
laptop
.

But
challenges
,
and
the
songs
that
score
them
,
add
a
connective
,
traceable
nervous
system
to
the
writhing
mass
of
grainy
video
loops
.

Their
revivals
underscore
the
appeal
of
a
good
challenge
,
artistic
or
otherwise
:
discomfort
,
growth
,
and
a
meaningful
connection
.

It
would
be
much
safer
,
Plato
thought
,
to
entrust
power
to
carefully
educated
guardians
.

Like
many
people
I
know
,
I
’ve
spent
recent
months
staying
up
late
,
reading
polls
in
terror
.

Caplan
dismisses
retrospective
voting
,
quoting
a
pair
of
scholars
who
call
it
“
no
more
rational
than
killing
the
pharaoh
when
the
Nile
does
not
flood
.
”

But
there
was
nothing
else
obviously
artistic
about
her
or
in
her
behavior
with
other
people
.

In
2010
,
the
foundation
released
a
typeset
edition
of
“
Zettel
’s
Traum
,
”
removing
the
bar
to
entry
for
those
who
balked
at
the
draft
-
like
feel
of
the
photo
-
offset
.

Corresponding
with
Woods
by
e-mail
,
I
tried
my
hand
at
uncovering
an
etym
.

“
Complete
neglect
of
his
own
health
,
”
his
wife
,
Alice
,
reported
.

Each
map
in
the
exhibition
tells
its
own
story
,
not
all
factual
.

Also
being
exhibited
for
the
first
time
are
British
Ministry
of
Defence
maps
which
imagine
cold
war
battles
and
which
were
used
in
military
college
exams
.

The
constituency
is
in
the
council
area
of
North
Kesteven
,
where
62
%
of
voters
backed
leaving
the
EU
.

His
skill
in
getting
answers
for
taxpayers
will
be
sorely
missed
.

Christian
Wolmar
,
who
has
written
a
number
of
books
on
railway
history
,
will
stand
in
the
contest
on
1
December
.

The
Liberal
Democrats
,
who
represented
the
affluent
suburb
until
2010
,
are
hoping
to
snatch
it
back
with
their
candidate
Sarah
Olney
.

Meanwhile
,
the
estranged
wife
of
a
government
whip
has
launched
her
campaign
to
take
the
seat
.

He
was
utterly
gracious
and
took
it
like
a
man
,
I
am
beyond
furious
.

More
than
330
crew
are
onboard
the
ship
.

Vega
suggested
that
,
because
of
their
age
,
many
would
be
unaware
of
its
history
.

People
got
killed
there
.

A
coal
-
fired
power
station
in
Badarpur
,
south
-
east
Delhi
,
will
stop
operating
for
10
days
,
along
with
diesel
generators
in
the
city
.

He
then
spent
four
years
with
BBC
World
Service
radio
at
Bush
House
.

He
worked
for
the
BBC
for
a
decade
.

One
of
their
many
grieving
Facebook
posts
has
a
line
which
would
have
delighted
Chris
:
“
More
African
than
you
,
I
have
not
known
.
”

Who
can
stop
this
Australia
side
?

Was
their
divine
right
to
the
mantle
as
the
world
’s
best
no
longer
warranted
?

They
have
one
crack
at
redemption
,
beating
England
.

South
Africa
are
almost
at
the
point
of
no
return
and
we
have
to
be
able
to
match
their
desire
.

He
has
got
that
hard
edge
to
his
game
but
also
the
soft
hands
.

We
have
a
great
squad
and
it
is
an
opportunity
for
us
to
take
the
ship
forward
.

You
have
to
stand
up
to
that
and
I
would
rather
someone
ran
at
me
rather
than
round
me
.

It
was
as
though
he
was
flicking
the
ball
back
and
forth
underneath
three
upturned
cups
.

Australia
,
hardened
by
their
recent
games
in
the
Rugby
Championship
,
were
in
a
higher
gear
.

A
Donald
Trump
victory
would
immediately
make
the
world
more
worrying
and
unsettled
than
it
already
is
.

Mrs
Clinton
has
a
reputation
for
a
hawkish
outlook
,
but
this
will
be
tempered
by
war
-
weary
public
opinion
in
the
US
.

He
’s
spoken
in
favour
of
torture
.

I
also
struggle
with
passwords
.

Then
there
are
the
so
-
called
true
stories
that
get
posted
in
a
series
of
meaningful
pictures
with
text
running
underneath
.

Of
course
,
I
do
understand
that
modern
-
day
Germany
must
be
separated
from
the
Nazi
regime
.

In
the
corner
is
a
girl
in
a
headscarf
and
jeans
who
looks
so
unassuming
I
think
it
’s
another
assistant
.

Artists
reach
people
at
their
heart
;
it
’s
the
only
time
we
meet
in
one
place
and
put
our
differences
aside
.

His
more
unusual
accolades
include
global
ambassador
for
New
York
City
Health
and
Hospitals
Corporation
,
and
a
place
at
Harvard
Business
School
.

I
can
just
do
that
with
my
life
.

I
wanted
to
watch
it
with
them
,
but
they
decided
they
’d
rather
watch
it
without
me
in
the
end
.

We
ca
n’t
let
the
presidency
go
to
Donald
Trump
,
someone
so
racist
,
sexist
and
incredibly
unqualified
to
be
commander
-
in
-
chief
.

“
More
people
are
turning
to
credit
…
While
this
borrowing
might
be
manageable
now
,
a
sudden
change
in
circumstances
could
lead
to
debt
problems
.
”

Her
reason
is
that
it
provides
insufficient
protection
to
American
workers
whose
jobs
and
living
standards
it
might
harm
.

In
this
context
,
railing
against
trade
makes
sense
.

Theoretically
,
a
couple
could
open
four
Tesco
accounts
and
earn
3
%
on
£
12,000
–
£
360
.

Meanwhile
,
Bank
of
Scotland
customers
earn
3
%
on
balances
of
£
3,000
-
£
5,000
when
they
add
the
free
Vantage
option
to
their
account
.

With
this
,
in
theory
,
you
are
able
to
access
your
money
whenever
you
like
.

That
3
%
rate
also
applies
to
Nectar
cardholders
looking
to
borrow
from
£
15,001
-
£
19,999
over
a
period
of
between
two
and
three
years
.

Sulphur
is
a
key
plant
nutrient
vital
to
healthy
growth
,
but
UK
soils
are
naturally
deficient
in
this
essential
mineral
.

Fast
forward
to
2016
and
this
is
increasingly
worthy
of
attention
.

Surprising
as
it
may
seem
,
even
acid
rain
clouds
can
have
a
silver
lining
.

The
world
may
be
enraging
and
absurd
–
yet
at
least
someone
has
the
self
-
respect
to
keep
protesting
against
that
fact
.

You
end
up
listening
more
acutely
for
the
next
noise
and
getting
more
irritated
when
it
comes
.

That
’s
just
legitimately
horrendous
.

It
’s
fair
to
say
that
Rocco
Catalano
works
,
lives
and
breathes
retro
.

I
think
that
’s
why
they
immersed
themselves
in
pattern
and
colour
.

Catalano
moved
back
to
the
area
after
living
in
London
and
then
Glasgow
,
where
he
had
studied
jewellery
design
at
Glasgow
School
of
Art
.

“
I
loved
the
tropical
colours
,
”
he
says
.

“
I
visit
the
degree
shows
at
Northampton
University
to
spot
new
talent
,
”
he
says
.

But
,
when
I
suggest
that
she
get
Frank
to
model
for
her
,
she
laughs
.

Naturally
,
the
office
landscape
features
many
clothes
and
little
in
the
way
of
food
.

Wintour
herself
appears
briefly
,
and
is
filmed
putting
her
sunglasses
on
before
being
interviewed
.

I
looked
at
motocross
and
the
more
I
looked
,
this
one
woman
’s
face
kept
coming
up
,
in
photographs
that
looked
as
if
they
were
from
the
1970s
.

I
love
to
play
with
that
and
I
am
always
looking
for
muses
that
fit
that
bill
because
it
is
so
interesting
making
a
collection
when
I
find
one
.

At
best
it
is
naive
and
at
worst
it
would
yet
again
let
the
shooting
lobby
off
the
hook
.

Their
head
of
nature
policy
,
Jeff
Knott
,
stated
:
“
I
’d
be
amazed
if
either
a
ban
or
licensing
was
introduced
off
the
back
of
it
”
.

The
RSPB
’s
stance
has
also
brought
it
into
conflict
with
many
leading
conservationists
,
from
the
author
of
the
petition
,
Mark
Avery
,
to
the
TV
presenter
Chris
Packham
.

Let
’s
just
say
he
’s
wrong
.

And
what
about
Australia
’s
position
?

On
this
,
one
diary
point
in
Morocco
will
be
the
middle
Saturday
,
when
developed
countries
get
to
publicly
question
each
other
about
their
plans
and
ambitions
.

“
We
are
actively
thinking
of
possible
ways
to
limit
the
scope
of
litigation
to
only
those
with
a
real
standing
in
a
project
,
”
he
was
quoted
as
saying
.

“
Celtic
Sea
cod
could
collapse
,
”
without
the
proposed
limits
,
one
EU
official
said
.

But
big
reductions
have
also
been
pencilled
in
for
cod
,
sole
,
plaice
,
megrim
and
pollack
in
the
Celtic
and
Irish
Seas
.

Conservationists
welcomed
the
commission
’s
announcement
.

Only
50
were
marketplaces
.

“
Agora
was
invitation
-
only
but
many
of
these
marketplaces
are
easily
accessible
if
you
know
how
to
search
,
”
Dr
Lee
adds
.

They
did
n’t
have
them
in
our
day
,
and
people
without
children
express
through
their
disapproval
all
their
hatred
of
modern
parenting
.

I
do
n’t
call
it
a
beast
lightly
.

Day
three
,
I
was
back
on
the
EMicro
.

The
world
–
and
by
extension
the
UK
–
is
facing
a
shortage
of
people
with
the
skills
needed
to
mount
an
effective
defence
.

Companies
may
try
to
set
up
a
firewall
between
sensitive
systems
and
foreign
powers
,
but
it
does
not
always
work
.

But
they
can
at
least
lay
booby
-
traps
to
confuse
and
deter
–
a
concept
known
as
“
active
defence
”
.

After
I
discovered
a
rich
seam
of
internet
discussion
on
the
subject
,
my
list
had
grown
inordinately
long
and
covered
almost
every
state
in
the
union
.

I
spotted
a
few
.

My
next
stop
was
Bellingham
,
right
up
near
the
Canadian
border
.

Back
on
the
train
,
we
continue
southwards
.

A
small
town
with
two
minarets
glides
by
.

At
each
station
,
a
red
-
capped
guard
presides
over
the
platform
and
a
wheel
-
tapper
walks
along
the
train
with
a
hammer
,
gently
knocking
the
undercarriage
.

Afterwards
,
browse
at
the
morning
market
(
6.30
-
10
am
)
:
rice
lollipops
,
wasp
cocoons
(
the
pupae
are
considered
a
delicacy
)
,
buffalo
lung
,
betel
-
nut
bark
and
leaves
,
live
toads
and
catfish
.

The
intervention
is
potentially
the
most
far
-
reaching
by
Beijing
since
the
1997
handover
of
Hong
Kong
from
the
UK
.

The
oath
involves
lawmakers
swearing
allegiance
to
Hong
Kong
as
part
of
the
People
’s
Republic
of
China
.

The
Hong
Kong
government
,
which
is
led
by
pro-Beijing
lawmakers
,
have
argued
that
the
pair
should
not
take
office
.

“
Beijing
believes
its
intervention
is
necessary
to
prevent
a
continued
legislative
paralysis
in
the
city
,
”
he
said
.

Hong
Kong
,
meanwhile
,
appears
to
be
bracing
for
a
wave
of
protests
.

He
told
the
BBC
’s
Andrew
Marr
Show
:
“
A
general
election
is
frankly
the
last
thing
that
the
Government
wants
.
”

It
is
his
dream
to
end
his
career
here
.

To
draw
a
game
you
have
dominated
is
easy
to
brush
off
,
but
to
do
so
three
times
is
a
row
suggests
a
weakness
.

We
are
so
disappointed
because
we
have
dropped
six
points
playing
at
home
.

That
was
definitely
the
case
for
Andy
when
he
played
Benoît
Paire
in
Monte
Carlo
in
April
.

But
right
now
everything
is
out
of
kilter
and
he
seems
to
be
seeking
answers
all
the
time
.

I
also
wonder
whether
the
Davis
Cup
played
a
part
.

The
annual
survey
also
revealed
that
worries
about
taking
on
fresh
financial
burdens
has
rocketed
.

Ms
Hopley
added
:
“
The
spike
in
political
risk
should
not
go
unnoticed
.
”

News
of
the
company
’s
deceit
-
which
had
run
for
years
-
wiped
tens
of
billions
of
euros
from
VW
's
value
and
cost
chief
executive
Martin
Winterkorn
his
job
.

It
has
also
opened
VW
up
to
huge
compensation
claims
,
legal
action
and
has
seen
it
take
more
than
€
16bn
of
provisions
.

The
probe
began
in
June
,
focusing
on
Mr
Winterkorn
and
brand
chief
Herbert
Diess
,
who
remains
at
the
car
maker
.

He
was
promoted
to
chairman
in
October
2015
,
the
month
after
the
scandal
was
unearthed
.

Businesses
had
expected
to
start
contracting
in
July
,
immediately
after
the
Brexit
vote
,
but
instead
have
managed
to
keep
growing
steadily
.

Retail
and
wholesale
businesses
expanded
as
shoppers
remained
upbeat
,
and
consumer
services
companies
also
grew
.

There
will
be
limits
to
his
ability
to
spend
,
however
,
as
the
Government
is
still
running
a
substantial
budget
deficit
.

The
cost
will
change
monthly
and
the
price
is
expected
to
rise
in
winter
as
usage
increases
.

Eon
’s
fixed
rate
tariff
costs
£
760
and
Avro
Energy
customers
would
pay
around
£
760
for
its
Simple
and
Select
tariff
.

Or
is
it
an
expensive
standard
or
prepayment
tariff
?

An
investor
with
average
luck
and
£
10,000
in
bonds
could
expect
to
receive
£
125
in
prizes
per
year
.

If
they
did
,
Premium
Bonds
would
be
indistinguishable
from
ordinary
savings
accounts
.

The
money
invested
in
Premium
Bonds
,
and
in
other
National
Savings
&
Investments
accounts
,
is
used
to
help
fund
Government
spending
.

This
has
not
stopped
investors
flocking
to
put
their
money
in
the
funds
.

It
was
followed
by
the
Aviva
Investors
Multi
Strategy
Target
Return
and
Income
funds
,
into
which
investors
put
£
2bn
and
£
1.4bn
respectively
.

This
means
that
they
have
not
benefited
from
the
uplift
that
the
fall
in
sterling
has
given
to
overseas
assets
.

Adidas
is
helping
to
clean
up
the
Earth
's
oceans
by
using
the
waste
floating
around
the
world
to
make
shoes
.

The
consumer
can
boost
the
demand
for
change
.

A
major
report
in
January
said
oceans
would
contain
more
plastic
than
fish
by
2050
unless
the
world
took
radical
action
to
stop
rubbish
leaking
into
the
seas
.

After
some
genius
surgery
and
a
lot
of
very
tough

,
I
have
made
a
full
recovery

Warning
that
the
NHS
was
now

Four
in
10
adults

Last
year
was
an
incredible
year
and
I
’m
ready
for
us
to
come
back
even
better
in
2017
.

She
started
out
at
the
RSC
in
the
mid-Sixties
playing
an
asylum
-
inmate
in
Marat
/
Sade
.

The
dress
is
contemporary
.

Where
does
all
her
energy
come
from
?
Or
that
voice
,
which
can
blast
out
with
a
force
to
induce
shockwaves
?

Her
neck
pushes
forward
in
vein
-
accentuating
confrontation
,
her
hands
shake
.

But
having
allowed
Glenda
to
score
such
a
blinder
,
who
can
blame
it
?

He
worked
on
the
news
and
current
affairs
side
of
radio
and
TV
for
decades
.

In
theory
,
if
done
right
,
it
’s
un-detectable
.

Drop
the
mic
.

According
to
the
director
's
own
count
,
to
date
he
has
made
eight
feature
films
.

"
Cinema
had
changed
so
drastically
that
Hollywood
had
alienated
the
family
audience
.
"

From
the
director
's
point
of
view
,
the
film
is
a
precarious
balancing
act
,
between
cheery
family
hijinks
and
hard
-
hitting
social
drama
.

On
one
level
,
it
works
as
an
amiable
,
unpretentious
heartwarmer
that
seems
tailor
-
made
for
Sunday
afternoon
viewing
.

And
,
of
course
,
there
's
Bob
,
a
constant
source
of
entertainment
.

The
result
,
then
,
is
hardly
the
cat
's
pyjamas
.

To
modern
audiences
,
most
of
whom
will
have
little
experience
of
frontline
conflict
,
Doss
’s
feats
belong
to
the
realm
of
the
unimaginable
.

Doss
’s
story
also
has
an
unlikely
quality
to
it
that
makes
it
all
the
more
appealing
.

All
the
medics

When
Millican
died
,
we
assumed
that
was
the
last
we
’d
see
of

twitchy

Is
series
two
working
so
far
?

“
Superheroes
are
outside
of
human
experience
and
so
is
this
,
so
I
treated
it
like
a
drama
,
”
Zimmer
says
.

But
Cotton
’s
dark
deeds
did
not
occur
due
to
some
sort
of
compulsion
to
kill
.

Cotton
was
born
on
October
31
,
1832
,
in
a
village
near
Sunderland
.

Perhaps
it
wo
n’t
matter
as
I
wo
n’t
be
troubled
long
.

No
longer
a
throwback
to
the
Seventies
,
flock
–
or
coating
a
surface
is
material
–
is
flying
again
.

London

Of
course
,
the
tactile
trend
is
closely
linked
to
our
growing
obsession
with
making
things
.

Two
years
later
,
Jutting
,
now

,
is
on
trial
at
Hong

's
High
Court
,
charged
with
two
counts
of
murder
and
one
of
preventing
lawful
burial
.

I
do
n't
know
why
I
chose
her
...

In
Hong
Kong
's
High
Court
,
two
years
later
,
Jutting
appeared
largely
composed
.

After
all
,
our
organizational
performance
is
seldom
measured
in
terms
of
how
safe
we
are
or
how
many
rules
we
follow
.

As
a
result
,
many
people
quickly
open
emails
or
mindlessly
click
on
links
and
attachments
with
nary
a
thought
of
its
consequences
.

First
,
we
must
educate
people
on
how
to
protect
themselves
better
online
.

Finally
,
we
must
make
it
easy
for
people
to
report
suspected
breaches
and
malicious
emails
.

Voting
has
,
in
the
vernacular
of

,
become
the

the
most
existential
kind

Tuesday
is
all
about
getting
out
the
vote
,
but
it
means
nothing
if
a
registered
voter
is
n't
on
the
list
.

Enough
of
those
,
in
a
highly
contested
area
,
will
lead
to
chaos
election
day
.

North
Carolina
is
ground
zero
in
this
election
.

Donald
Trump
is
a
pompous
,
arrogant
,
entitled
person
that
cares
about
himself
,
and
his
temperament
is
toxic
to
the
United
States
.

More
than
5.7
million
Floridians
have
already
hit
the
polls
after
about
two
weeks
of
in
-
person
early
voting
.

The
GOP
lead
was
carried
by
strong
numbers
in
absentee
voting
,
and
their
overall
edge
stood
at
about
16,500
earlier
this
week
.

It
's
the
election
,
of
course
,
not

Martin

of

The
Dutch
students
have
yet
to
decide
if
they
will
be
commercializing
their
electric
motorcycle
.

A
Harley

Davidson
spokeswoman
said
timelines
that
have
been
floated
in
the
media
--
2017
or
2020
--
are
n't
accurate
.

U.S.
stock

are
surging
by
more
than
1
%
,
alongside
European

He
is
credited
with
helping

tackle
the
mountain

in
China
.

But
it
only
came
forward
after
the
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
alerted
the
world
to
the
issue
.

China
's
insatiable
appetite
for
fried
chicken
used
to
be
a
big
reason
why
investors
loved
KFC

With

As

Celebrities

I
had

option
to
send

,
custom

The
move
highlighted
the
company
's
desire
for
users
to
start
thinking
of
its
products
as
more
than
just
productivity
tools

But
its

effort
into
the

game
is
a
part
of
a
larger
trend
from
tech
companies
.

Snowman
would
jump
the

that
separated

and
always
return
to
where
he
felt
was

He
kept
on
turning
up
at

I
joked
to
the
guy
that
clearly
he
did
n't
want
to
be

anything

There
is
no
parade
and
there
never
has
been
.

It
's
an
event
Mexico
hopes
will
eventually
rival
the
Carnival
of
Brazil
.

Alejandra
González
Anaya
,
one
of
the
parade

creative
directors
,
explained
to
CNN
why
Mexico
have
decided
now
is
the
time
to
put
on
such
a
show
.

"
There
are
1200
volunteers
working
for
the
parade
alone
,
"
González
Anaya
says
.

So
it
's
wonderful
to
be
able
to
rescue
that
and
bring
it
to
a
new
format
and
a
new
tradition
for
Mexicans
.

By

The
Bergeron
classification
is
the
most
widely
accepted
form
of
air
mass
classification
.

While
air
mass
identification
was
originally
used
in
weather
forecasting
during
the
1950s
,
climatologists
began
to
establish
synoptic
climatologies
based
on
this
idea
in

A
variety

major
Slavic
tribes
crossed
through
Moravia
during
the
Migration
Period
before
Slavs
established
themselves
in
the
6th
century
AD
.

At
the
end
of
the
8th
century
,
the
Moravian
Principality
came
into
being
in
present

day
south
-
eastern
Moravia
,
Záhorie
in
south
-
western
Slovakia
and
parts
of
Lower
Austria
.

In
833
AD
,
this
became
the
state
of
Great
Moravia
with
the
conquest
of
the
Principality
of
Nitra
(

Although
Iceland
was
under
the
political
control
of
Denmark
until
a
much
later
date
(
1918
)
,
very
little
influence
and
borrowing
from
Danish
has
occurred
in
the
Icelandic
language
.

There
are
also
languages
derived
from
Finnish
,
having
evolved
separately
,
known
as
Meänkieli
in
Sweden
and
Kven
in
Norway
.

Consonant
gradation
is
a
feature
in
both
Finnish

northern
Sami

but
it
is
not

,
which
is
considered
to
have
a
different

The

The
Sahel
's
climate
is
similar
to
,
but
less
extreme
than
,
the
climate
of
the
Sahara
desert
located
just
to
the
north
.

In
June
to
August
2010
famine
struck
the

Several
ancient
civilisations
were
located
around
the
Mediterranean
shores
,
and
were
greatly
influenced
by
their
proximity
to
the
sea
.

It
provided
routes
for
trade
,
colonisation
,
and
war
,
as
well
as
food
(
from
fishing
and
the
gathering
of
other
seafood
)
for
numerous
communities
throughout
the
ages
.

Due
to
the
shared
climate
,
geology
,
and
access
to
the
sea
,
cultures
centered
on
the
Mediterranean
tended
to
have
some
extent
of
intertwined
culture
and
history
.

Two
of
the
most
notable
Mediterranean
civilisations
in
classical
antiquity
were
the
Greek
city
states
and
the
Phoenicians
,
both
of
which
extensively
colonised
the
coastlines
of
the
Mediterranean
.

Later
,
when
Augustus
founded
the
Roman
Empire
,
the
Romans
referred
to
the
Mediterranean
as
Mare
Nostrum
(
"
Our
Sea
"
)
.

The
Blindleia
is
a
skerry

In

Alcoholic

Whatever
the
rules
were
,
the
fights
often
resulted
in
the
death
of
one
of
the
stallions
.

The
Schlei
and
the
wetlands
between
the
Danevirke
and
Husum
had
frozen
solid
in
a
hard
winter
,
and
the
territory
immediately
south
of
the
Danevirke
had
been
conquered
by
the
advancing
German
army
.

This
retreat
came
as
a
surprise
to
the
Austro
-
Prussian
army
,
and
almost
all
of
the
Danish
army
succeeded
in
completing
the
evacuation
.

It
resulted
,
however
,
in
the
abandonment
of
important
pieces
of
heavy
artillery
,
and
it
remains
a
matter
of
historical
debate
why
the
railway
to
Flensburg
was
never
properly
used
for
the
evacuation
.

News
of
the
retreat
came
as
a
great
shock
to
Danish
public
opinion
which
had
considered
the
Danevirke
to
be
impregnable
,
and
General
de
Meza
was
promptly
relieved
of
his
command
.

The
Danevirke
has
remained
in
German
possession
ever
since
.

The

The
climate
is
so
dry
that
these
plains
are
sometimes
thought
of
as
part
of

It
differs
from
the
western
portion
of

country
in
that
its
prominent
topographic

At
the
heart
of
the
conflict
was
the
question
of
whether
Kansas
would
enter
the
Union
as
a
free

state
.

National
reaction
to
the
events
in

The
Alps
provide
lowland
Europe
with
drinking
water
,
irrigation
,
and
hydroelectric
power
.

Although
the
area
is
only
about
11
percent
of
the
surface
area
of
Europe
,
the
Alps
provide
up
to
90
percent
of
water
to
lowland
Europe
,
particularly
to
arid
areas
and
during
the
summer
months
.

Cities
such
as
Milan
depend
on
80
percent
of
water
from
Alpine
runoff
.

Water
from
the
rivers
is
used
in
over
500
hydroelectricity
power
plants
,
generating
as
much
as
2900
kilowatts
of
electricity
.

Major
European

flow
from
Switzerland
,
such
as
the
Rhine
,
the
Rhône
,
the
Inn
,
the
Ticino
and
the
Po
,
all
of
which
have
headwaters
in
the
Alps
and
flow
into
neighbouring
countries
,
finally
emptying
into
the
North

to
be
very
viscous
due
to
its
high
silica
content
,
so
it
often
does
not
reach
the
surface
but
cools
at
depth
.

They
generally
do
not
explode
catastrophically
.

Global
warming
has
caused
a
change
in
the
pattern
of
the
rainy
seasons

It
contains
a
tiny
lagoon
,
which
has
all

dried
up

It
was
declared
a
wildlife
sanctuary
in
1975
.

Investigation
and
expeditions
to
the
island
continue

Such
settlements
probably
began
around
1000
BC

when
eastern
Melanesians

Habitat
destruction
vastly
increases
an
area
's
vulnerability
to
natural
disasters
like
flood
and
drought
,
crop
failure
,
spread
of
disease
,
and
water
contamination
.

On
the
other
hand
,
a
healthy
ecosystem
with
good
management
practices
will
reduce
the
chance
of
these
events
happening
,
or
will
at
least
mitigate
adverse
impacts
.

Agricultural
land
can
actually
suffer
from
the
destruction
of
the
surrounding
landscape
.

Over
the
past
50
years
,
the
destruction
of
habitat
surrounding
agricultural
land
has
degraded
approximately
40
%
of
agricultural
land
worldwide
via
erosion
,
salinization
,
compaction
,
nutrient
depletion
,
pollution
,
and
urbanization
.

Humans
also
lose
direct
uses
of
natural
habitat
when
habitat
is
destroyed
.

Papua

is
often
labelled
as
potentially
the

still
present
in
Papua

Christopher
Columbus
sailed
across
the
Atlantic
Ocean
to
the
West
Indies
in
1492
,
sparking
a
period
of
European
exploration
of
the
Americas
.

These
are
not
very
popular
due
to
the
often
remote
and
roadless
locations
.

Various
private
interests
own
the
remaining
land
,
totaling
about
one
percent
of
the
state
.

This
is
also
the
only
region
in
Alaska
in
which
the
average
daytime
high
temperature
is
above
freezing
during
the
winter
months
.

Numerous
indigenous
peoples
occupied
Alaska
for
thousands
of
years
before
the
arrival
of
European
peoples
to
the
area
.

It
was
here
they
stole
a
small

As
Brisbane
grew
,
the
condition
of
the
river
worsened
until
at
its
worst
it
was
no
more
than
an
open
sewer
and
waste
dump
.

1987
was
proclaimed
the
"

Sand
and
dust
storms
are
natural
events
that
occur
in
arid
regions
where
the
land
is
not
protected
by
a
covering
of
vegetation
.

Dust
storms
usually
start
in
desert
margins
rather
than
the
deserts
themselves
where
the
finer
materials
have
already
been
blown
away
.

As
a
steady
wind
begins
to
blow
,
fine
particles
lying
on
the
exposed
ground
begin
to
vibrate
.

At
greater
wind
speeds
,
some
particles
are
lifted
into
the
air
stream
.

When
they
land
,
they
strike
other
particles
which
may
be
jerked
into
the
air
in
their
turn
,
starting
a
chain
reaction
.

However
,
in
Thailand
,
urbanization
has
also
resulted

Thunderstorms
are

,
as
the

By
1340
,
Cairo
had
a
population

close
to
half
a
million
,
making
it
the
largest
city
west
of
China
.

Meanwhile
,
additional
controls
of
the
Nile
fostered
development
within
Gezira

The
name
"
Caribbean
"
derives
from
the
Caribs
,
one
of
the
dominant
Native
American
groups
in
the
region
at
the
time
of
European
contact
during
the
late
15th
century
.

After
the
discovery
of
America
by
Christopher
Columbus
in
1492
,
the
Spanish
term
Antillas
applied
to
the
lands
;
stemming
from
this
,
"
Sea
of
the
Antilles
"
became
a
common
alternative
name
for
"
Caribbean
Sea
"
in
various
European
languages
.

During
the
first
century
of
development
,
Spanish
dominance
in
the
region
remained
undisputed
.

From
the
16th
century
,
Europeans
visiting
the
Caribbean
region
identified
the
"
South
Sea
"
(
the
Pacific
Ocean
,
to
the
south
of
the
isthmus
of
Panama
)
as
opposed
to
the
"
North
Sea
"
(
the
Caribbean
Sea
,
to
the
north
of
the
same
isthmus
)
.

The
Caribbean
Sea
had
been
unknown
to
the
populations
of
Eurasia
until
1492
,
when
Christopher
Columbus
first
sailed
into
Caribbean
waters
on
a
quest
to
find
a
sea
route
to
Asia
.

Unfortunately
,
rapid
population
growth
and
urban
sprawl
has
covered
much
of
these
ecosystems
with
development

Cape

's
local
government
is
the
City
of
Cape
Town
,
which
is
a

The
essay
,
published
as
Undersea
,
was
a
vivid
narrative
of
a
journey
along
the
ocean
floor
.

She
also
took
advantage
of
her
personal
connections
with
many
government
scientists
,
who
supplied
her
with
confidential
information
.

By
mid-1962
,
Brooks
and
Carson
had
largely
finished
the
editing
,
and
were
laying
the
groundwork
for
promoting
the
book
by
sending
the
manuscript
out
to
select
individuals
for
final
suggestions
.

This
brought
the
book
to
the
attention
of
the
chemical
industry
and
its
lobbyists
,
as
well
as
a
wide
swath
of
the
American
populace
.

In
the
1350s
,
King
Gongmin
was
free
at
last
to
reform
the
Goryeo
government
when
the
Yuan
dynasty
began
to
crumble
.

Since
the
1960s
,
the
South
Korean
economy
has
grown
enormously
and
the
economic
structure
was
radically
transformed
.

It
usually
involves
a
low
level
of
development
,
such
as
rustic
picnic
areas
,
benches
and
trails
.

Australia
's
Royal
National
Park
,
established
in
1879
,
was
the
world
's
second
officially
established
national
park
.

First
and
foremost
was
the
provision
of
open
space
for
the
benefit
of
townspeople
and
local
residents
within
an
area
that
was
being
rapidly
built
up
.

With
the
fall
of
the
Qing
dynasty
in
1911
,
Mongolia
under
the
Bogd
Khaan
declared
independence
.

But
,
the
newly
established
Republic
of
China
considered
Mongolia
to
be
part
of
its
own
territory
.

Yuan
Shikai
,
the
President
of
the
Republic
of
China
,
considered
the
new
republic
to
be
the
successor
of
the
Qing
.

Bogd
Khaan
said
that
both
Mongolia
and
China
had
been
administered
by
the
Manchu
during
the
Qing
,
and
after
the
fall
of
the
Qing
dynasty
in
1911
,
the
contract
of
Mongolian
submission
to
the
Manchu
had
become
invalid
.

The
area
controlled
by
the
Bogd
Khaan
was
approximately
that
of
the
former
Outer
Mongolia
during
the
Qing
period
.

In
his
haste
to
capture
Kadesh
,
Ramesses
II
committed
a
major
tactical
error
.

Indeed
,
the
first
scholarly
report
on
the
battle
,
by
James
Henry
Breasted
in
1903
,
praised
the
sources
that
allowed
the
reconstruction
the
battle
with
certainty
.

Ramesses
,
logistically
unable
to
sustain
a
long
siege
,
returned
to
Egypt
.

The
Egyptian
pharaoh
thus
found
himself
in
northern
Amurru
,
well
past
Kadesh
,
in
Tunip
,
where
no
Egyptian
soldier
had
been
seen
since
the
time
of
Thutmose
III
almost
120
years
earlier
.

This
time
he
claimed
to
have
fought
the
battle
without
even
bothering
to
put
on
his
corslet
until
two
hours
after
the
fighting
began
.

The
exact
year
of
the
marriage
of
Herod
Antipas
and
Herodias
is
subject
to
debate
among
scholars
.

Given
that
Herod
was
in
Jerusalem
at
that
time
,
Pilate
decided
to
send
Jesus
to
Herod
to
be
tried
.

According
to
the
New
Testament
,
Paul
spent
eighteen
months
in
Corinth
,
approximately
seventeen
years
after
his
conversion
.

The
latter
date
can
only
have
fallen
on
a
Friday
if
an
exceptional
leap
month
had
been
introduced
that
year
,
but
this
was
favoured
by
Newton
.

It
is
possible
to
establish
the
phase
of
the
moon
on
a
particular
day
two
thousand
years
ago
but
not
whether
it
was
obscured
by
clouds
or
haze
.

Forts
were
also
built
in
the
older
portions
of
New
France
that
had
not
yet
been
settled
.

It
set
the
basis
for
integration
where
the
economic
and
judicial
mechanisms
of
the
state
could
be
applied
throughout
the
Mediterranean
as
was
once
done
from
Latium
into
all
Italy
.

Each
poem
narrates
only
a
part
of
the
war
.

In
later
ages
playwrights
,
historians
,
and
other
intellectuals
would
create
works
inspired
by
the
Trojan
War
.

It
was
foretold
that
he
would
either
die
of
old
age
after
an
uneventful
life
,
or
die
young
in
a
battlefield
and
gain
immortality
through
poetry
.

However
this
was
reversed
when
Julian
was
killed
in
battle
in
363
.

The
last
Olympic
Games
are
believed
to
have
been
held
in
393
.

Shen
Kuo
soon
impressed
Wang
Anshi
with
his
skills
and
abilities
as
an
administrator
and
government
agent
.

In
1072
,
Shen
was
sent
to
supervise
Wang
's
program
of
surveying
the
building
of
silt
deposits
in
the
Bian
Canal
outside
the
capital
city
.

Using
an
original
technique
,
Shen
successfully
dredged
the
canal
and
demonstrated
the
formidable
value
of
the
silt
gathered
as
a
fertilizer
.

He
gained
further
reputation
at
court
once
he
was
dispatched
as
an
envoy
to
the
Khitan
Liao
Dynasty
in
the
summer
of
1075
.

The
Khitans
had
made
several
aggressive
negotiations
of
pushing
their
borders
south
,
while
manipulating
several
incompetent
Chinese
ambassadors
who
conceded
to
the
Liao
Kingdom
's
demands
.

Medicine
was
also
studied
,
especially
in
southern
Italy
,
where
Islamic
medicine
influenced
the
school
at
Salerno
.

Tiberius
reportedly
regretted
his
departure
and
requested
to
return
to
Rome
several
times
,
but
each
time
Augustus
refused
his
requests
.

He
seems
to
have
wished
for
the
Senate
and
the
state
to
simply
act
without
him
and
his
direct
orders
were
rather
vague
,
inspiring
debate
more
on
what
he
actually
meant
than
on
passing
his
legislation
.

The
gods
represented
distinctly
the
practical
needs
of
daily
life
,
and
they
were
scrupulously
accorded
the
rites
and
offerings
considered
proper
.

This
was
by
boat
from
continental
Europe
.

Cultic
remains
discovered
at
the
site
were
a
row
of
ten
large
standing
stones
,
known
as
massebot
,
oriented
north
-
south
,
the
tallest
of
which
was
3
meters
high
,
with
an
altar
-
type
structure
in
the
middle
,
and
a
large
,
square
,
stone
basin
.

The
exact
purpose
of
these
megaliths
is
still
debated
,
but
they
may
have
constituted
a
Canaanite
"
high
place
"
from
the
Middle
Bronze
Age
,
ca.
1600
B.C.E.

The
Canaanite
city
was
destroyed
in
a
fire
,
presumably
in
the
wake
of
a
campaign
by
the
Egyptian
pharaoh
Thutmose
III
.

The
oldest
known
historical
reference
to
the
city
is
to
be
found
on
an
inscription
of
conquered
sites
at
Thutmose
's
temple
at
Karnak
.

The
Tell
Amarna
letters
,
dating
from
the
14th
century
BCE
,
include
ten
letters
from
the
kings
of
Gezer
swearing
loyalty
to
the
Egyptian
pharaoh
.

Thai
birth
certificates
record
the
date
,
month
and
time
of
birth
,
followed
by
the
day
of
the
week
,
lunar
date
,
and
the
applicable
zodiac
animal
name
.

Her
zodiacal
animal
is
the
Monkey
and
her
traditionally
significant
sixtieth
anniversary
year
was
1992
.

Thai
auspicious
colours
of
the
day
are
given
in
the
table
of
weekdays
,
followed
below
it
by
a
link
to
the
Buddha
images
for
each
day
of
the
week
.

Chinese
New
Year
and
other
feasts
observed
by
Thai
Chinese
vary
with
respect
to
both
,
as
these
are
calculated
according
to
the
Chinese
calendar
.

In
addition
,
he
strengthened
defenses
between
Egypt
and
Asia
,
building
the
Walls
of
the
Ruler
in
the
East
Delta
region
.

He
reigned
only
fifteen
years
,
which
is
evidenced
by
the
incomplete
nature
of
many
of
his
constructions
.

Despite
this
,
they
both
seem
to
have
held
at
least
parts
of
lower
Egypt
.

On
September
9
,
2002
,
Aldrin
was
lured
to
a
Beverly
Hills
hotel
on
the
pretext
of
being
interviewed
for
a
Japanese
children
's
television
show
on
the
subject
of
space
.

Aldrin
has
been
married
three
times
.

In
1519
,
he
became
ruler
of
the
Habsburg
empire
,
and
he
gained
the
title
Holy
Roman
Emperor
in
1530
.

Charles
,
despite
his
harsh
actions
,
had
been
seen
as
a
ruler
empathetic
to
the
needs
of
the
Netherlands
.

In
1566
,
a
league
of
about
400
members
of
the
nobility
presented
a
petition
to
the
governor
Margaret
of
Parma
,
to
suspend
persecution
until
the
rest
had
returned
.

Its
struggle
against
the
Ottoman
Empire
in
the
Mediterranean
Sea
put
serious
limits
on
the
military
power
it
could
deploy
against
the
rebels
in
the
Netherlands
.

A
Bronze
Age
astronomical
observatory
was
constructed
there
around
1900
BC
and
continuously
served
the
nearby
community
that
lived
there
until
about
700
BC
.

The
central
space
was
used
to
observe
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
full
moon
.

Three
markings
locate
sunrise
at
the
summer
and
winter
solstices
and
at
the
two
equinoxes
.

Four
more
give
the
minimum
and
maximum
declinations
of
the
full
moon
:
in
summer
,
and
in
winter
.

Two
measure
the
lengths
of
lunar
months
.

Its
importance
resides
in
two
facts
.

During
the
Post
-
Classic
period
in
Yucatán
a
third
system
was
in
use
.

The
origin
of
the
word
Hispania
is
much
disputed
and
the
evidence
for
the
various
speculations
are
based
merely
upon
what
are
at
best
mere
resemblances
,
likely
to
be
accidental
,
and
suspect
supporting
evidence
.

But
the
impact
of
Hispania
in
the
newcomers
was
also
big
.

During
the
first
stages
of
Romanization
,
the
peninsula
was
divided
in
two
by
the
Romans
for
administrative
purposes
.

By
the
3rd
century
the
emperor
Caracalla
made
a
new
division
which
lasted
only
a
short
time
.

They
had
been
so
moved
by
the
beauty
of
the
Rudyard
Lake
area
that
when
their
first
child
was
born
they
referenced
it
when
naming
him
.

During
his
time
there
,
Kipling
also
met
and
fell
in
love
with
Florence
Garrard
who
was
boarding
with
Trix
at
Southsea
(
to
which
Trix
had
returned
)
.

Stephen
Wheeler
,
the
editor
,
worked
Kipling
hard
,
but
Kipling
's
need
to
write
was
unstoppable
.

Back
in
Lahore
,
some
thirty
-
nine
stories
appeared
in
the
Gazette
between
November
1886
and
June
1887
.

By
this
time
,
he
had
been
increasingly
thinking
about
the
future
.

Jin
Ping
Mei
,
published
in
1610
,
although
incorporating
earlier
material
,
marks
the
trend
toward
independent
composition
and
concern
with
psychology
.

Higher
male
secondary
school
enrollment
,
per
capita
income
and
economic
growth
rate
all
had
significant
effects
on
reducing
the
chance
of
civil
war
.

Specifically
,
a
male
secondary
school
enrollment
10
%
above
the
average
reduced
the
chance
of
a
conflict
by
about
3
%
,
while
a
growth
rate
1
%
higher
than
the
study
average
resulted
in
a
decline
in
the
chance
of
a
civil
war
of
about
1
%
.

The
study
interpreted
these
three
factors
as
proxies
for
earnings
forgone
by
rebellion
,
and
therefore
that
lower
forgone
earnings
encourage
rebellion
.

Phrased
another
way
:
young
males
(
who
make
up
the
vast
majority
of
combatants
in
civil
wars
)
are
less
likely
to
join
a
rebellion
if
they
are
getting
an
education
or
have
a
comfortable
salary
,
and
can
reasonably
assume
that
they
will
prosper
in
the
future
.

Low
per
capita
income
has
been
proposed
as
a
cause
for
grievance
,
prompting
armed
rebellion
.

Its
guarantee
of
liberties
promised
to
dissolve
inter-communal
tensions
and
transform
the
empire
into
a
more
harmonious
place
.

The
Arab
Revolt
which
began
in
1916
turned
the
tide
against
the
Ottomans
on
the
Middle
Eastern
front
,
where
they
initially
seemed
to
have
the
upper
hand
during
the
first
two
years
of
the
war
.

It
specifically
discusses
in
several
passages
the
socially
and
culturally
degenerative
effects
of
war
on
humanity
itself
.

Dominican
priest
Heinrich
Kramer
was
assistant
to
the
Archbishop
of
Salzburg
.

In
1538
the
Spanish
Inquisition
cautioned
its
members
not
to
believe
everything
the
Malleus
said
.

Forced
baptism
was
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
and
theoretically
anybody
who
had
been
forcibly
baptized
could
legally
return
to
Judaism
.

Spain
had
expelled
its
Sephardic
population
in
1492
;
many
of
these
Spanish
Jews
left
Spain
for
Portugal
but
eventually
were
targeted
there
as
well
.

The
Macedonian
eastern
border
with
Thrace
was
now
secured
at
the
river
Nestus
(
Mesta
)
.

Philip
next
marched
against
his
southern
enemies
.

In
Thessaly
he
defeated
his
enemies
and
by
352
,
he
was
firmly
in
control
of
this
region
.

The
Macedonian
army
advanced
as
far
as
the
pass
of
Thermopylae
which
divides
Greece
in
two
parts
,
but
it
did
not
attempt
to
take
it
because
it
was
strongly
guarded
by
a
joint
force
of
Athenians
,
Spartans
,
and
Achaeans
.

Having
secured
the
bordering
regions
of
Macedon
,
Philip
assembled
a
large
Macedonian
army
and
marched
deep
into
Thrace
for
a
long
conquering
campaign
.

Catherine
of
Russia
was
also
very
satisfied
.

Throughout
the
war
,
Pearl
Harbor
was
frequently
used
in
American
propaganda
.

This
idealized
vision
of
the
Romanov
monarchy
blinded
him
to
the
actual
state
of
his
country
.

The
Russian
Empire
was
an
agglomeration
of
diverse
ethnicities
that
had
shown
significant
signs
of
disunity
in
the
years
before
the
First
World
War
.

This
city
-
state
emerged
in
the
same
period
as
Sukhothai
.

This
contact
with
the
West
during
the
16th
century
lead
to
a
period
of
profound
economic
growth
as
lucrative
trade
routes
were
established
.

The
Army
performed
well
in
combat
in
Cuba
.

However
,
it
was
too
oriented
to
small
posts
in
the
West
and
not
as
well
-
prepared
for
an
overseas
conflict
.

It
relied
on
volunteers
and
state
militia
units
,
which
faced
logistical
,
training
and
food
problems
in
the
staging
areas
in
Florida
.

The
United
States
freed
Cuba
(
after
an
occupation
by
the
U.S.
Army
)
.

By
the
peace
treaty
Spain
ceded
to
the
United
States
its
colonies
of
Puerto
Rico
,
Guam
,
and
the
Philippines
.

The
offensive
against
the
huge
army
enlisted
by
Venice
was
launched
from
France
.

By
1563
,
the
population
of
Venice
had
dropped
to
about
168,000
people
.

Education
during
the
Renaissance
was
mainly
composed
of
ancient
literature
and
history
as
it
was
thought
that
the
classics
provided
moral
instruction
and
an
intensive
understanding
of
human
behavior
.

There
has
,
however
,
been
extensive
statistical
analysis
of
demographic
and
population
data
which
includes
women
,
especially
in
their
childbearing
roles
.

Most
of
the
information
about
the
period
comes
from
burial
sites
and
the
grave
goods
contained
within
them
.

At
this
time
there
were
only
around
forty
families
living
there
with
plenty
of
good
farming
land
and
grazing
for
cattle
.

As
Greece
sent
out
colonies
west
towards
Sicily
and
Italy
(
Pithekoussae
,
Cumae
)
,
the
influence
of
their
new
alphabet
extended
further
.

Bananas
and
plantains
,
which
were
first
domesticated
in
Southeast
Asia
,
most
likely
Papua
New
Guinea
,
were
re-domesticated
in
Africa
possibly
as
early
as
5,000
years
ago
.

Besides
being
a
direct
source
of
food
,
certain
animals
could
provide
leather
,
wool
,
hides
,
and
fertilizer
.

A
fundamental
change
in
working
principles
was
brought
about
by
Scotsman
James
Watt
.

The
Industrial
Revolution
created
a
demand
for
metal
parts
used
in
machinery
.

In
the
Second
Messenian
War
,
Sparta
established
itself
as
a
local
power
in
Peloponnesus
and
the
rest
of
Greece
.

Ford
T
was
proclaimed
as
the
most
influential
car
of
the
20th
century
in
the
international
Car
of
the
Century
awards
.

The
success
American
Motors
'
compact
-
sized
Rambler
models
spurred
GM
and
Ford
to
introduce
their
own
downsized
cars
in
1960
.

This
convention
is
only
slightly
relaxed
in
modern
age
and
now
it
is
still
unadvisable
among
friends
to
use
the
given
name
,
but
use
of
the
family
name
is
still
common
.

In
the
case
of
the
imperial
family
,
it
is
considered
extremely
inappropriate
to
use
the
given
name
.

Since
Emperor
Meiji
,
it
has
been
customary
to
have
one
era
per
Emperor
and
to
rename
each
Emperor
after
his
death
using
the
name
of
the
era
over
which
he
presided
.

Prior
to
Emperor
Meiji
,
the
names
of
the
eras
were
changed
more
frequently
,
and
the
posthumous
names
of
the
Emperors
were
chosen
in
a
different
manner
.

Outside
Japan
,
beginning
with
Emperor
Shōwa
,
the
Emperors
are
often
referred
to
by
their
given
names
,
both
whilst
alive
and
posthumously
.

In
Asia
and
the
Pacific
,
between
3
million
and
more
than
10
million
civilians
,
mostly
Chinese
(
estimated
at
7.5
million
)
,
were
killed
by
the
Japanese
occupation
forces
.

In
Europe
,
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
,
the
Allies
had
significant
advantages
in
both
population
and
economics
.

Land
warfare
changed
from
the
static
front
lines
of
World
War
I
to
increased
mobility
and
combined
arms
.

British
cavalry
troopers
also
received
excellent
mounted
swordsmanship
training
.

Some
historians
,
such
as
Chandler
and
Weller
,
assert
that
the
British
heavy
cavalry
were
destroyed
as
a
viable
force
following
their
first
,
epic
charge
.

According
to
a
genetic
study
on
autosomal

on
Roma
the
source
of
Southasian

in
Roma
is
North

West
India
.

Explanations
of
the
origin
of
music
depend
on
how
music
is
defined
.

Among
humans
both
males
and
females
are
ardent
singers
,
and
making
music
is
mostly
a
communal
activity
.

In
1839
,
China
found
itself
fighting
the
First
Opium
War
with
Great
Britain
after
the
Governor
-
General
of
Hunan
and
Hubei
,
Lin
Zexu
,
banned
the
foreign
trade
of
opium
.

China
was
defeated
,
and
in
1842
agreed
to
the
provisions
of
the
Treaty
of
Nanking
.

Hong
Kong
Island
was
ceded
to
Britain
,
and
certain
ports
,
including
Shanghai
and
Guangzhou
,
were
opened
to
British
trade
and
residence
.

In
1856
,
the
Second
Opium
War
broke
out
;
the
Chinese
were
again
defeated
and
forced
to
the
terms
of
the
1858
Treaty
of
Tientsin
and
the
1860
Convention
of
Peking
.

The
treaty
opened
new
ports
to
trade
and
allowed
foreigners
to
travel
in
the
interior
.

Lamarr
accompanied
Mandl
to
business
meetings
where
he
conferred
with
scientists
and
other
professionals
involved
in
military
technology
.

Lamarr
's
earliest
inventions
include
an
improved
traffic
stoplight
and
a
tablet
that
would
dissolve
in
water
to
create
a
carbonated
drink
.

She
was
offered
several
scripts
,
television
commercials
,
and
stage
projects
,
but
none
piqued
her
interest
.

Joseph
Darnand
,
who
became
an
SS
officer
and
led
the
Milice
paramilitaries
who
hunted
down
members
of
the
Resistance
,
was
executed
in
October
1945
.

De
Gaulle
had
instructed
that
there
be
no
excessive
displays
of
public
affection
towards
Churchill
and
no
official
awards
without
his
prior
agreement
.

The
film
chronicles
the
destruction
of
Carangi
's
life
and
career
as
a
result
of
her
addiction
to
heroin
,
and
her
decline
and
death
from
AIDS
in
the
mid-1980s
.

It
was
completed
rather
late
in
the
war
;
although
a
number
of
B-29s
were
equipped
with
Eagle
and
it
worked
well
,
it
came
too
late
to
make
much
difference
.

The
radar
system
for
which
Alvarez
is
best
known
and
which
has
played
a
major
role
in
aviation
,
most
particularly
in
the
post
war
Berlin
airlift
,
was
Ground
Controlled
Approach
(
GCA
)
.

Using
Alvarez
's
dipole
antenna
to
achieve
a
very
high
angular
resolution
,
GCA
allows
ground
-
based
radar
operators
watching
special
precision
displays
to
guide
a
landing
airplane
to
the
runway
by
transmitting
verbal
commands
to
the
pilot
.

The
system
was
simple
,
direct
,
and
worked
well
,
even
with
previously
untrained
pilots
.

It
was
so
successful
that
the
military
continued
to
use
it
for
many
years
after
the
war
,
and
it
was
still
in
use
in
some
countries
in
the
1980s
.

With
population
growth
,
new
indigenous
quarters
were
created
.

Failing
health
reduced
Hitchcock
's
output
during
the
last
two
decades
of
his
life
.

Hitchcock
's
films
sometimes
feature
characters
struggling
in
their
relationships
with
their
mothers
.

Hitchcock
preferred
to
work
with
the
best
talent
of
his
day
—
film
poster
designers
such
as
Bill
Gold
and
Saul
Bass
—
who
would
produce
posters
that
accurately
represented
his
films
.

A
mental
clash
gripped
Herzl
,
between
the
craving
for
literary
success
and
a
desire
to
act
as
a
public
figure
.

On
March
10
,
1896
,
Herzl
was
visited
by
Reverend
William
Hechler
,
the
Anglican
minister
to
the
British
Embassy
.

During
one
episode
,
he
is
shown
to
be
an
adept
guitar
player
.

Lenny
is
a
persistent

Deciding
to

Winstone
was
declared

again
on

Disney
also
found
out
that
Universal
owned
the
intellectual

However
,
his
rival
Prabowo
Subianto
also
declared
victory
,
leaving
Indonesian
citizens
confused
.

Prior
to
taking

Jokowi
sought
for
outgoing
President
Yudhoyono
to
take
responsibility
for
the
decision
to
further
increase

prices
by
further
removing
subsidies
.

His
official
biography
also
claims
that
Kim
composed
six
operas
and
enjoys
staging
elaborate
musicals
.

With
advice
from
Alexander
,
he
was
able
to
work
out
a
compromise
:
he
would
attend
a
university
,
but
would
study
literature
.

Barrie
enrolled
at
the
University
of
Edinburgh
where
he
wrote
drama
reviews
for
the
Edinburgh
Evening
Courant
.

He
graduated
and
obtained
an
M.A.
on
21
April
1882
.

Following
a
job
advertisement
found
by
his
sister
in
The
Scotsman
,
he
worked
for
a
year
and
a
half
as
a
staff
journalist
on
the
Nottingham
Journal
.

He
then
returned
to
Kirriemuir
.

Only
3000

Between
1991
and
1997
,
she
ran
a
school
for
children
with
learning
disabilities
.

Her
latest
non-fiction
is
about
Margaret
Douglas
,
Countess
of
Lennox
.

She
found
the
transition
to
fiction
easy
,
explaining
,
"
Every
book
is
a
learning
curve
,
and
you
have
to
keep
an
open
mind
.
"

To
avoid
experiencing
a
similar
dilemma
with
Jasmine
,
the
filmmakers
ultimately
decided
to
have
the
princess
animated
entirely
at
one
studio
.

With
her
appearance
finalized
,
Jasmine
became
Disney
's
first
non-white
princess
as
opposed
to
being
of
European
heritage
.

Thematically
,
Jasmine
also
represents
civil
rights
,
racial
tolerance
,
social
hierarchy
,
as
well
as
life
,
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
.

However
,
there
was
no
further
public
recognition
of
her
wartime
resistance
and
humanitarian
work
until
after
the
end
of
communist
rule
in
Poland
.

Having
enjoyed
a
career
peak
at

in
Australia
,
Geyer
returned
to
live
in
Los
Angeles
in
1984
to
concentrate
on
breaking
into
the
musical
scene
there
.

George
was
deeply
devout
and
spent
hours
in
prayer
,
but
his
piety
was
not
shared
by
his
brothers
.

George
was
appalled
by
what
he
saw
as
their
loose
morals
.

In
1770
,
his
brother
Prince
Henry
,
Duke
of
Cumberland
and
Strathearn
,
was
exposed
as
an
adulterer
,
and
the
following
year
Cumberland
married
a
young
widow
,
Anne
Horton
.

Her
1981
album
Wild
West
was
one
of
her
biggest
sellers
.

By
this
time
,
extravagant
spending
and
a
string
of
bad
investments
by
her
investors
had
left
her
nearly
broke
.

In

(
1992
)
reunited
him
with
his
Stealers
Wheel
partner
Egan
on
several
tracks
.

It
included
three
tracks
cowritten
with
Rafferty
's
brother
Jim
,
also
a
singer
-
songwriter
,
who
had
been
signed
to
Decca
Records
in
the
1970s
.

Rafferty
recorded
a
new
version
of
his
Humblebums
song
"
Her
Father
Did
n't
Like
Me
Anyway
"
on
the
album
Over
My
Head
(
1994
)
.

These
were
the
last
two
records
Rafferty
produced
with
Hugh
Murphy
,
who
died
in
1998
.

At
least
330,000
people
,
including
10,000
technicians
,
were
involved
.

Stalin
had
begun
to
encourage
Abakumov
to
form
his
own
network
inside
the
MGB
to
counter
Beria
's
dominance
of
the
power
ministries
.

The
patterns
presented
by
the
data
from
the
Petén
region
and
Uaxactun
allowed
for
these
sites
to
fit
within
the
cultural
development
of
the
Maya
lowlands
.

The
article
by
Thompson
assumes
that
the
Maya
were
ultimately
“
peaceful
”
people
since
they
lacked
apparent
defenses
.

Sails
are
not
represented
in
prehistoric
Mesoamerican
iconography
or
texts
,
instead
,
it
is
theorized
that
canoes
were
used
as
a
primary
mode
of
water
transportation
for
the
ancient
Maya
.

Starlin
took
over
as
plotter
the
following
issue
,
and
began
developing
an
elaborate
story
arc
centered
on
the
villainous
Thanos
,
and
spread
across
a
number
of
Marvel
titles
.

Concurrently
in
the
mid-1970s
,
Starlin
contributed
a
cache
of
stories
to
the
independently
published
science
-
fiction
anthology
Star
Reach
.

Through
his
grandmother
,
Mishima
was
a
direct
descendant
of
Tokugawa
Ieyasu
.

In
1955
,
Mishima
took
up
weight
training
and
his
workout
regimen
of
three
sessions
per
week
was
not
disrupted
for
the
final
15
years
of
his
life
.

Mishima
espoused
a
very
individual
brand
of
nationalism
towards
the
end
of
his
life
.

In
2011
,
Blunt
was
named
the
ambassadress
of
the
new
Yves
Saint
Laurent
fragrance
,
Opium
.

Blunt
starred
in
the
2011
British
comedy
film
Salmon
Fishing
in
the
Yemen
,
directed
by
Lasse
Hallström
and
co-starring
Ewan
McGregor
and
Kristin
Scott
Thomas
.

Also
that
year
,
she
briefly
appeared
in
Disney
's
The
Muppets
,
as
Miss
Piggy
's
receptionist
.

She
starred
in
the
2012
film
The
Five
-
Year
Engagement
,
directed
by
Nicholas
Stoller
and
co-starring
Jason
Segel
.

In
January
2011
,
Blunt
began
filming
an
American
science
-
fiction
film
,
Looper
,
directed
by
Rian
Johnson
and
co-starring
Bruce
Willis
and
Joseph
Gordon
-
Levitt
;
the
film
was
released
in
September
2012
.

Valentino
tried
to
distance
the
character
from
a
stereotypical
portrayal
of
an
Arab
man
.

Joseph
Schenck
was
interested
in
casting
his
wife
,
Norma
Talmadge
,
opposite
Valentino
in
a
version
of
Romeo
and
Juliet
.

Lord
Halifax
,
the
Lord
President
of
the
Council
,
visited
Germany
privately
in
November
and
met
Hitler
and
other
German
officials
.

In
addressing
the
Cabinet
shortly
after
German
forces
crossed
the
border
,
Chamberlain
placed
blame
on
both
Germany
and
Austria
.

In
May
,
Czech
border
guards
shot
two
Sudeten
German
farmers
who
were
trying
to
cross
the
border
into
Czechoslovakia
without
stopping
for
border
controls
.

During
this
time
,
Marcelle
was
often
left
alone
in
the
room
while
Piaf
and
Mômone
were
out
on
the
streets
or
at
the
club
singing
.

These
were
almost
completely
forgotten
until
after
Smith
's
death
.

Another
theme
of
the
Skylark
novels
involves
precursors
of
modern
information
technology
.

As
early
as
1926
,
Meyer
had
written
to
Irène
Joliot
-
Curie
suggesting
that
Rona
work
with
her
to
learn
how
his
laboratory
could
make
their
own
polonium
samples
.

Once
Hans
Pettersson
was
able
to
secure
funds
to
pay
Rona
's
expenses
,
Joliot
-
Curie
allowed
her
to
come
and
study
polonium
separation
at
the
Curie
Institute
in
Paris
.

Rona
developed
an
enhanced
method
of
preparing
polonium
sources
and
producing
alpha
-
emissions
.

Gaining
recognition
as
an
expert
in
the
field
,
she
took
those
skills
back
to
the
Radium
Institute
along
with
a
small
disc
of
polonium
.

This
disc
allowed
Rona
to
create
lab
specimens
of
polonium
,
which
were
used
in
much
of
the
Institute
's
subsequent
research
.

During
the
2013
off
-
season
she
appeared
on
CTV
Montreal
as
a
guest
weather
anchor
.

She
next
faced
defending
champion
and
top
seed
Sara
Errani
,
but
was
defeated
.

Bouchard
suffered
a
shocking
three
-
set
loss
.

When
their
daughter
Cecily
married
Richard
Plantagenet
,
the
3rd
Duke
of
York
,
and
had
several
offspring
,
including
Edward
IV
and
Richard
III
,
Joan
became
the
grandmother
of
two
York
kings
of
England
.

John
of
Gaunt
died
in
1399
.

The
knight
Lyvet
was
released
and
his
follower
thrown
into
the
Tower
.

Not
long
ago
he
was
divorced
from
the
actress
,
Gloria
Holden
,
but
carried
the
torch
after
the
marital
rift
.

He
co-starred
as
Humphrey
Bogart
's
younger
brother
,
a
carefree
playboy
,
in
Sabrina
(
1954
)
,
played
by
Audrey
Hepburn
.

He
chose
not
to
seek
a
third
term
in
the
following
election
cycle
.

The
1980
presidential
campaign
between
Reagan
and
incumbent
President
Jimmy
Carter
was
conducted
during
domestic
concerns
and
the
ongoing
Iran
hostage
crisis
.

Republicans
captured
the
Senate
for
the
first
time
since
1952
,
and
gained
34
House
seats
,
but
the
Democrats
retained
a
majority
.

He
recovered
and
was
released
from
the
hospital
on
April
11
,
becoming
the
first
serving
U.S.
president
to
survive
being
shot
in
an
assassination
attempt
.

Reagan
believed
that
God
had
spared
his
life
so
that
he
might
go
on
to
fulfill
a
greater
purpose
.

Bloch
is
concerned
to
establish
hope
as
the
guiding
principle
of
his
Marxism
and
stresses
the
implied
humanism
inherent
in
mystical
tradition
.

A
proper
theology
would
therefore
have
to
be
constructed
in
the
light
of
its
future
goal
.

Pebe
moved
the
family
to
Nashville
,
Tennessee
,
in
1991
after
securing
a
new
publishing
deal
for
her
songwriting
.

Kesha
and
Pebe
co-wrote
the
song
"
Stephen
"
together
when
Kesha
was
16
,
Kesha
then
tracked
down
David
Gamson
,
a
producer
that
she
admired
,
from
Scritti
Politti
who
agreed
to
produce
the
song
.

As
of
August
2015
,
Kesha
has
released
little
information
about
her
upcoming
third
studio
album
.

This
time
it
reached
him
,
but
he
refused
to
believe
that
she
no
longer
wanted
to
be
married
to
him
.

Wright
was
born
in
Poole
,
Dorset
,
but
grew
up
predominantly
in
Wells
,
Somerset
.

Wright
has
a
brother
,
Oscar
,
who
is
a
comic
book
artist
,
contributing
storyboards
,
conceptual
art
and
promotional
pictures
for
Edgar
's
films
.

Wright
is
a
friend
of
fellow
director
Garth
Jennings
,
and
made
cameos
in
his
films
The
Hitchhiker
's
Guide
to
the
Galaxy
and
Son
of
Rambow
.

The
Great
Powers
did
not
fulfill
the
requests
for
recognition
of
Albania
.

At
the
beginning
of
the
London
conference
in
December
1912
the
ambassadors
of
all
six
Great
Powers
rejected
the
plan
for
establishing
an
independent
Albania
.

Instead
,
they
decided
that
Albania
would
be
under
Ottoman
suzerainty
but
with
an
autonomous
government
.

After
it
became
obvious
that
Ottoman
Empire
would
lose
all
of
Macedonia
and
its
territorial
connection
with
Albania
,
the
Great
Powers
realized
they
had
to
change
their
decision
.

The
Treaty
of
London
,
signed
on
30
May
1913
,
partitioned
significant
part
of
territory
claimed
by
Albania
,
regardless
its
ethnic
composition
,
between
the
Balkan
allies
reducing
the
territory
of
Albania
to
its
central
regions
.

did
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
others
would
also
be
investigated
.

The

One
does
n't
know
in
which
way
both
dramatists
would
have
worked
together
.

A
Swedish
study
has
shown
that

According
to
Parker
,
Russian
Secret
Service
agents
are
active
in
large
numbers
in
Great
Britain
.

Russia
announced
a
suspension
of
the
contract
at
the
beginning
of
October
.

The
law
delineates
a
number
of
conditions
whose
fulfillment
could
bring
the
agreement
back
into
effect
:
the
USA
would
have
to
withdraw
all
of
its
troops
from
countries
who
joined
NATO
after
2000
,
rescind
all
of
the
sanctions
against
Russia
as
well
as
reimburse
the
costs
that
have
been
incurred
as
a
result
of
the
sanctions
.

It
is
a
political
process
and
I
have
decided
not
to
be
present
,
so
it
was
said
.

If
a
Turkish
employee
quits
,
then
the
Turkish
work
councils
come
.

From
this
point
of
view
,
stale
structures
and
a
self
-
satisfied
elite
are
the
reason
why
the
health
system
,
education
and
foreign
trade
in
the
USA
is
in
such
bad
shape
.

Kühn
can
only
shake
his
head
.

The
newspaper
"
Die
ZEIT
"
first
inquired
with
the
real
estate
business
about
its
dubious
cash
flows
and
the
threat
of
insolvency
in
July
.

The
witching
hour
starts
up
at
least
by
the
time
the
scary
organ
is
played
,
such
as
in
the
60s
hit
Monster
Mash
.

Von
Beust
justified
the
cost
increases
as
lack
of
detailed
planning
.

Simon
Krätschmer
gropes
around
alone
through
the
dilapidated
,
sinister
barrack

That
is
because
each

every
miracle
and
each
specialized
district
occupies
an
entire
field
.

Production
of
the
smartphone
model
was
completely
discontinued
.

It
was
August

2015
,
as
an

ducks
conquered
the

.

The
smartphone
generation
received
an
app
it
deserved
,
where
,
in
the
best
case
scenario
,
the
most
idiotic
situation
received
an
audience
of
millions
.

For
Kerber
,
the
season
finale
nevertheless
marks
the
end
of
an
unbelievable
year
.

After
the
sensation
at
the
Australian
Open
,
the
28
year
-
old
lost
for
the
first
time
in
the
final
game
against
Serena
Williams
.

It
is
now
only
unclear
,
in
which
one
.

Do
you
argue
with
your
alarm
clock
?

It
's
clear
:
Men
could
have
more
responsibility

matters
of

.

According
to
Christian
belief
,
a
grave
which
had
been
embedded
in
the
chalkstone
was
the
last
resting
place
of
Jesus
.

The
reason
for
advertising
the

Germany
is
unclear
.

I
was
asked
by
the
officers
,
in
their
inimitably
dumb
way
,
whether
I
knew
the
writer
Günter

and
whether
we
are
intellectual
relatives
.

The
Canadian
investigator
of
the
plane
crash
Larry
Vance
told
SPIEGEL
that
he
is
convinced
that
one
of
the
pilots
had
intended
to
land
the
machine
on
the
ocean
surface
-
so
that
it
would
sink
.

The
Australian
experts
drew
new
conclusions
from
the
investigation
of
a
landing
flap
from
Boeing
that
had
washed
up
in
Tanzania
in
East
Africa
.

The
issue
might
not
be
over
for
Barroso
.

The
exchange
of
Barrosos
caused
a
big
stir
.

The
current
arrests
are
"
a
continuation
of
the
shenanigans
against
us
,
"
said
Dündar
.

For
the
time
being
,
the
deal
between
Aoun
and
Hariri
has
brought
the
two
enemy
factions
closer
together
.

The
husband
of
the
current
candidate
for
the
White
House
,
Hillary
Clinton
,
pardoned
a
number
of
people
,
also
including
Rich
,
on
the
last
day
of
his
presidency
,
January
20
,
2001
.

Dündar
warned
Europe
about
having
too
much
understanding
for
Erdogan
's
course
.

Adnan
Z.
Amin
,
General
Director
of
the
International
Organization
for
Renewable
Energies
(
IRENA
)
is
certain
:
"
Offshore
wind
power
can
become
the
top
power
generator
in
a
global
economy
that
is
free
of
coal
-
based
energy
.
"

The
good
numbers
in
Asia
promptly
pushed
the
stock
markets
up
.

One
expects
a
bump
from
the
booming
real
estate
market
and
increasing
federal
expenditures
.

The
two
paintings
by
Lucas
Cranach
the
Elder
on
display
are
especially
eye
-
catching
.

Therefore
the
irksome
signs
will
not
completely
disappear
:
According
to
information
from
the
news
agency
dpa
,
they
will
only
be
activated
if
,
for
instance
,
the
artist
or
record
label
is
not
a
member
of
GEMA
and
does
not
have
an
agreement
with
YouTube
.

The
contaminants
not
only
attack
the
undeveloped
lungs
of
the
little
ones
;
they
can
also
lead
to
long
-
term
impairment
in
the
development
of
the
adolescent
brain
.

It
is
no
surprise
that
the
federal
and
state
governments
have
classified
the
National
Natural
Heritage
as
a
nation
-
wide
endeavor
of
the
highest
priority
and
have
documented
it
starting
in
2005
in
a
coalition
contract
.

Unlike
that
of
the
28th
of
October
,
Mr.
Comey
's
letter
has
hardly
been
commented
upon
.

If
his
Democrat
opponent
were
to
be
elected
,
he
assured
that
she
would
be
'
under
investigation
for
years
'
.

"
If
somebody

mocked
.

According
to

,
she

On
Tuesday
,
the
United
States
of
America
could
elect
the
first
female
president
in
its
history
.

On
the
other
hand
,
Ms.
Clinton
's
relations
with
the
continent
over
the
past
twenty
years
leave
much
to
be
desired
.

The
AKP
's
Islamic
conservatives
have
taken
this
refusal
as
justification
for
the
questionings
.

A
third
-
party
majority
is
needed
,
specifically
the
votes
of
367
MPs
(
out
of
550
)
,
whereas
330
votes
are
required
in
order
to
trigger
a
referendum
.

On
Thursday
,
the
3rd
of
November
,
the
mayor
of
Saint
-
Gaudens
(
in
the
Haute
-
Garonne
region
)
decided
to
suspend
the
urban
development
agreement
with
the
government
formed
in
2014
.

The
latter
is
overseeing
the
Republican
primaries
,
in
which
Rachida
Dati
supports
Nicolas
Sarkozy
's
candidacy
.

In
the
message
,
the
former
Minister
for
Justice
accused
Brice
Hortefeux
of
being
a
'
fascist
'
,
'
Minister
(
moron
)
of
the
Interior
'
and
a
'
thug
'
.

What
are
the
limits
that
could
inhibit
the
expression
of
religious
beliefs
in
private
companies
?

Even
if
the
majority
of
situations
that
arise
in
the
workplace
can
be
resolved
without
conflict
.

Are

The
Force
Ouvrière
union
regrets
that
its
remarks
on
the
content
of
the
guide
were
not
included
:
"
There
was
n't
really
any
consultation
,
"
said
Ms.
Gillard
.

The
guide
is
problematic
,
firstly
because
it
has
been
developed
"
in
the
context
of
a
state
of
emergency
"
.

This
clause
included
the

The
two
organisations
launched
an
appeal
which
was
thrown
out
by
the
Court
of
Cassation
on
the
12th
of
October
.

It
aims
to
take
the
journey
time
into
account
after
deducting
this
from
the
working
hours
actually
completed
,
without
being
able
to
measure
the
real
journey
time
.

The
working
time
undertaken
in
this
first
hour
is
more
or
less
equal
to
45
minutes
.

"
the

The

According
to

Tina
Anselmi
was
born
on
the
25th
of
March
,
1927
in
Castelfranco
Veneto
;
she
grew
up
in
an
anti-fascist
Catholic
family
,
which
was
marked
by
the
persecution
of
her
militant
socialist
father
.

Having
always
been
close
to

Tina

It
is
difficult
to
think
that
Italy
has
fewer
km
of
underground
line
than
Madrid
.

It
has
been
emphasised
that
we
absolutely
can
not
continue
with
those
who
are
completely
against
Italy
.

We
will
evaluate
whether
and
how
to

there
will

The

have
stated
in
a
note
,
that
there
will
be
no
rise
in
VAT
,
for

at

A

in

is
at
the
top
of
the

The

tell
us
that
our
diesel
costs
1,335
euros
per
litre
,
compared
with
the
eurozone
average
of
1,165
euros
.

A
significantly
higher
cost
which
clearly
exceeds
the
average
of
the
countries
that
adopt
the
single

,
which
is
equal
to
1,365

Corrado
Passera
withdraws
the
offer
for
Mps
due
to
"
the
attitude
of
total
closure
that
the

has
shown
to
us
"
.

As
stated
,
the
decision
is
the
prerogative
of
the
ECB
and
would
appear
inappropriate
for
the
Bank
to
speak
on
its
behalf
by
excluding
the
possibility
of
looking
at
other
alternatives
.

This
is
what
has
been
written
in
a

to
Mps
after
the
decision
of
the
ex-minister
to
leave
the

It

The

of

represents
the
most
conservative
,
while

,
represent
the
most
progressive

For
the
first
time
in
the
last
six
years
the
rate
of
unemployment
has
dropped
below
20
%
,
and
there
are
already
600,000
more
people
employed
than
there
were
a
year
ago
.

Its
management
,
however
,
has
n't
been
devoid
of
criticism
.

The
unions
have
been
very
combative
and
on
several
occasions
have
called
for
the
repeal
of
the
legislation
that
Fátima
Báñez
is
proudest
of
.

This
department
now
faces
new
challenges
.

Furthermore
,
the
Government
will
have
to
deal
with
another
"
hot
potato
"
.

The
Minister
of
Defense
has
allowed
her
to
remain
General
Secretary
of
the
party
for
now
.

The
consulted
sources
have
said
that
it
is
"
100
%
Cospedal
"
.

In
spite
of
them
,
not
everyone
in
the
party
understood
the
messages
that
the
president
tried
to
send
to
them
yesterday
.

Barón
de
Claret
,
the
only
one
in
Government
with
a
noble
title
.

Pedro
Sánchez
,
like
many
other
socialists
,
said
in
the
programme
Évole
that
Spain
is
a
nation
of
nations
.

And
what
about
the
parties
in
what
,
in
historical
rights
?

Federico
Fellini
once
said
:
"
The
clown
is
to
humanity
as
the
shadow
is
to
man
"
.

He
stands
alone
in
front
of
the
audience
and
,
ultimately
,
he
has
to
bring
out
the
best
of
himself
in
order
to
make
the
audience
laugh
.

In
the
war
films
or
cowboy
and
Indian
films
the
battles
,
fights
and
beatings
were
out
of
this
world
.

Emphasis
,
fine
irony
,
blunt
innuendos
and
other
well
used
verbal
devices
fit
into
parliamentary
oratory
,
but
flicking
at
each
other
and
slapstick
comedy
do
not
.

He
believes
that
nobody
waiting
for
us
waits
for
us
.

Perhaps
that
's
why
a
surge
of
tears
clouds
his
pupils
while
the
syllable
of
time
unearths
his
crop
and
surrenders
his
mystery
to
the
bound
waters
.

And
they
must
be
greeted
with
an
open
spirit
and
clear
mind
because
they
form
the
new
generation
of
beauty
and
hope
.

As
a
result
,
Trump
is
n't
very
worried
about
the
Latin
American
vote
at
a
national
level
.

The
early
voting
suggests
that
this
time
the
Latin
Americans
will
come
out
to
vote
in
greater
numbers
,
but
it
is
unclear
whether
the
increase
will
have
an
impact
.

"
There
will
be
protests

Founded
in
1925
as
games
for
everyman
,
the
open
air
theater
on
the
great
steps
in
front
of
St.
Michael
still
attracts
a
diverse
public
.

The
festive
dedication
took
place
on
April
30
,
1955
.

In
1882
,
a
telegraphic
system
equipped
with
34
fire
alarm
signals
was
put
in
operation
.

In
1992
,
grounds
of
the
former
puppet
theater
,
which
had
been
left
to
the
commune
,
were
taken
over
by
players
and
employees
.

This
has
to
do
with
one
of
the
few
buildings
in
the
city
center
that
was
spared
from
destruction
by
the
end
of
the
Second
World
War
.

In
1832
,
the
former
cloister
was
sold
to
the
manufacturer
Georg
Reichenbach
by
the
state
of
Württemberg
with
the
stipulation
to
establish
a
cotton
factory
there
.

The
Islamic
citizens
who
have
settled
since
the
beginning
of
the
1960s
emigrated
primarily
from
Turkey
.

Among
them
is
the
former
cloister
from
the
abbey
church
of
St.
Peter
and
Paul
.

The
historical
city
hall
in
Obermarsberg
originates
from
the
13th
century
and
was
refurbished
after
the
Thirty
Years
'
War
.

There
are
different
theories
about
the
reasons
for
leaving
the
place
.

Golden
Gate
Park
,
which
is
over
four
kilometers
in
length
,
offers
a
botanical
garden
,
planetarium
,
Japanese
garden
and
an
aquarium
.

It
serves
as
a
local
place
of
rest
and
relaxation
for
San
Franciscans
.

The
Yerba
Buena
Garden
was
built
at
the
beginning
of
the
1990s
on
the
roof
of
the
Moscone
North
Convention
Center
.

It

Since
the
1960s
,
the
city
's
economy
has
been
in
steep
decline
.

During
the
2010
general
election
,
the
Labor
Party
was
able
to
win
all
seven
voting
districts
.

Both
the
time
and
the
sequence
of
events
of
this
incident
were
vigorously
discussed
.

In
April
2012
,
the
Turkish
Minister
President
Erdogan
announced
his
government
's
plans
to
free
Bosphorus
by
building
the
Istanbul
Canal
parallel
to
it
.

The
Ottomans
wanted
to
prevent
grain
from
being
further
transported
because
they
had
a
great
need
for
it
.

The
Ottoman
Empire
and
Russia
were
denied
permission
to
keep
their
war
fleet
in
the
Black
Sea
.

In
its
scope
it
belongs
to
the
most
far
-
reaching
cultures
of
the
time
,
in
which
many
sites
are
known
.

Like
the
majority
of
sites
in
southern
Europe
,
the
finding
dates
back
to
the
early
5th
century
BC
.

Likely
the
most
well
-
known
person
from
the
Copper
Age
is
Ötzi
,
the
frozen
mummy
who
lived
during
3300
BC
.

They
were
primarily
on
hills
.

In
addition
,
its
process
of
gilding
copper
is
technologically
noteworthy
.

The
severity
and
the
presence
of
the
revolution
in
the
countryside
alarmed
the
Court
and
National
Assembly
in
Versailles
.

The
event
was
known
about
in
Paris
and
caused
more
upset
in
a
mood
which
was
already
charged
by
the
persistently
high
price
of
bread
and
lack
of
provisions
.

The
king
did
not
take
special
precautions
during
his
escape
and

The

was
well
received
and
the

demanded
an
encore

The
First
World
War
brought
about
shifts
and
new
developments
in
colonial
politics
.

The
Industrial
Revolution
took
place
in
Great
Britain
earlier
than
in
any
other
country
.

The
Suez
Crisis
showed
the
limits
of
the
old
colonial
powers
such
as
Great
Britain
and
France
in
a
changing
world
.

After
the
seizure
of
power
by
the
National
Socialists
in
1933
there
were
dispersed
attempts
to
win
back
the
old
colonies
.

After
the
Russian
Revolution
in
1917
,
some
countries
,
such
as
Finland
,
Poland
and
the
Baltic
States
,
won
their
independence
.

One
of
his
last
means
of
placing
pressure
on
Hungary
was
the
threat
of
imposing
general
and
free
elections
.

After
the
Compromise
,
Emperor
and
King
Franz
Joseph
I.
took
great
care
to
treat
both
of
his
monarchies
equally
.

The
Disibodenberg
cloister
was
disbanded
and
fell
into
ruin
as
a
result
of
the
Reformation
.

Today
,
expansive
ruins
can
be
viewed
there
.

The
Rupertsberg
cloister
was
destroyed
during
the
Thirty
Years
'
War
in
1632
by
Swedish
troops
.

The
displaced
nuns
were
moved
to
the
Eibingen
cloister
.

The
ruins
were
later
built
over
.

After
these
successes
,
he
signed

lived
until

.

At

in
Athens
,

.

The
censorship
disposed
of
all
undesirable
opinions
;
participation
in
public
life
had
become
practically
impossible
.

The
traces
of
blood
on
the
clothes
were
in
the
shape
that
they
were

Privately
as
well
as

,
Springer
vigorously
pursued
reconciliation
with
the
Jewish
people
and
took
many
trips
to
Israel
.

The
chalet
burned
completely
down

In
the
following

,
he
received
the
distinction
of

Medal
for
the
friendly
position

In

,
the
British
ship
Endurance
,
captained
by

In
the
8th
century
BC
,
Greece
began
to
emerge
from
the
Dark
Ages
which
followed
the
fall
of
the
Mycenaean
civilization
.

Literacy
had
been
lost
and
Mycenaean
script
forgotten
,
but
the
Greeks
adopted
the
Phoenician
alphabet
,
modifying
it
to
create
the
Greek
alphabet
.

From
the
9th
century
BC
,
the
first
Greek
texts
began
to
appear
.

Greece
was
divided
into
many
small
,
self
-
governing
communities
,
a
pattern
largely
dictated
by
Greek
geography
:
every
island
,
valley
and
plain
is
cut
off
from
its
neighbours
by
the
sea
or
mountain
ranges
.

From
about
the
8th
century
BC
city
states
began
to
appear
:
small
,
self
-
governing
territories
with
their
own
political
systems
.

In
the
Middle
Ages
,
most
Christians
did
not
have
access
to
the
Bible
in
their
mother
tongue
.

However
,
they
did
not
expand
until
ships
big
enough
to
cross
seas
were
built
.

Trade
was
developed
by
establishing
commercial
outposts
throughout
the
Mediterranean
,
a
technique
that
had
not
been
used
until
then
.

This
affair
can
be
seen
as
the
starting
point
for
his
career
as
a
radical
revolutionary
.

In
Pluviose
year
III
(
January
-
February
1794
)
,
easing
off
the
pressure
of
the
Reign
of
Terror
,
he
took
various
measures
to
liberate
the
suspects
.

Financed
entirely
with
Bernard

worldwide
,
the
German
company
was
in
financial
trouble
.

To
get
away
from
it
all
,
the
Remis
resided
in
Switzerland
for
most
of
summer
1947
.

On
their
return
,
they
entertained
the
idea
of
living
in
South
America
,
far
away
from
the
problems
of
postwar
Belgium
.

In
spring
1948
,
in
hopes
of
adapting
Tintin
for
the
cinema
,
the
Belgian
artist
wrote
a
letter
to
Walt
Disney
,
asking
in
vain
for
his
support
.

In
the
summer
,
Georges
and
his
wife
returned
to
Switzerland
,
accompanied
by
Rosane
,
an
18
year
old
who
was
the
daughter
of
one
of
Germaine
's
friends
.

During
the
holiday
,
he
began
an
extra-marital
affair
with
the
young
girl
,
which
he
admitted
shortly
after
.

In
the
lower
part
,
there
are
three
palm
trees
overlooking
the
sea
,
which
represent
the
love
that
the
people
of
this
Island
have
for
their
land
.

Furthermore
,
the
occurrence
of
hurricanes
on
the
island
is
possible
during
the
summer
.

The
islands
are
located
at
the
Indo
-
Australian
Fault
;
the
Fault
arose
due
to
the
collision
of
the
Indian
and
Australian
plates
.

An
element
supporting
this
hypothesis
would
be
the
intense
royal
livestock
of
horses
that
took
place
at
Villa
Pelucca
,
in
Sesto
San
Giovanni
.

In
1928
,
a
90
-
hectare
golf
course
was
built
in
the
north
-
eastern
part
of
the
park
,
next
to
the
racetrack
.

In
1976
,
the
racecourse
was
no
longer
used
;
in
1990
,
a
fire
destroyed
what
remained
of
the
wooden
grandstands
,
which
were
later
demolished
along
with
the
stables
.

In
August
1969
,
Pope
Paul
VI
removed
the
death
penalty
from
the
Vatican
law
and
revoked
it
from
all
offences
.

The
issuing
of
coinage
is
predominantly
numismatic
in
nature
,
with
the
intention
of
being
sold
mainly
to
collectors
.

The
inner
part
of
the
region
is
flat
and
hilly
,
with
no
clear
distinction
between
one
area
to
the
next
.

There
are
many
prehistoric
artifacts
,
including
several
different
menhirs
and
dolmens
.

The
second
Apulian
and
Calabrian
Royal
Region
was
then
established
,
also
including
Samnium
,
parts
of
Molise
and
the
oriental
Basilicata
.

During
the
thirteenth
century
,
the
name
Apulia
was
used
by
some
authors
to
signify
the
southern
part
of
the
Italian
peninsula
.

Historian
David
Crouch
suggests
that
Stephen
abandoned
from
the
challenge
around
this
time
to
focus
on
other
issues
.

Only
a
handful
of
them
(
earldoms
)
had
existed
under
Henry
I
and
these
had
been
largely
symbolic
.

During
the
War
of
the
First
Coalition
,
light
quickly
began
to
be
shed
upon
a
young
Corsican
artillery
officer
,
following
the
French
Revolution
:
Napoleon
Bonaparte
.

Although
not
a
resolver
of
the
conflict
,
the
French
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Marengo
forced
the
Austrians
to
give
Italy
up
for
the
second
time
.

The
blockage
of
Villeneuve
's
fleet
resulted
in
giving
up
the
invasion
plan
of
the
British
Isles
,
also
because
new
developments
were
taking
place
in
the
continent
.

Napoleon
was
confident
that
the
clear
success
of
Austerlitz
could
lead
to
a
general
peace
treaty
,
but
his
hopes
were
soon
dashed
:
the
new
British
Prime
Minister
Lord
Grenville
refused
any
agreement
,
and
so
did
Tsar
Alexander
.

With
regards
to
religious
practices
,
Fiorello
was
educated
within
the
Episcopal
Church
,
and
remained
a
member
of
the
Protestant
Church
throughout
his
life
.

The
man
told
him
that
a
war
between
the
two
universes
is
coming
,
as
he
and
Walter
had
predicted
;
it
is
for
this
reason
that
Olivia
,
among
others
,
was
trained
as
a
child
.

Both
students
of
Goffredo
Petrassi
,
Ennio
Morricone
and
Bruno
Nicolai
met
at
the
Santa
(
Saint
)
Cecelia
conservatory
.

Between
them
bloomed
a
long
professional
and
amicable
relationship
that
lasted
for
years
.

Nicolai
collaborates
on
various
cinematic
scores
by
Morricone
as
Metti
,
one
night
at
dinner
;
some
of
them
were
written
by
both
together
.

However
,
the
friendship
has
fallen
apart
due
to
unofficial
collaborations
between
the
two
,
which
has
given
rise
to
legal
disputes
.

During
their
various
collaborations
,
it
is
not
clear
who
between
the
two
conceived
of
some
stylistic
solutions
in
the
arrangements
that
later
on
characterised
both
artists
'
style
.

In
the
20th
century
,
between
1904
and
1914
,
Antonio
Gaudí
brought
about
a
reform
that
lasted
ten
years
.

It
has
three
parallel
chapels
at
the
apse
and
many
lateral
chapels
between
the
buttresses
.

Tradition
has
it
that
the
theme
was
selected
intentionally
because
of
the
great
number
of
converted
Jews
who
lived
in
Palma
.

Before
the
Andes
were
formed
,
the
western
margin
of
South
America
had
already
been
the
site
of
several
orogenies
.

The
central
Andes
belong
to
the
so
-
called
'
Andes
de
tipo
andino
'
which
were
formed
by
the
subduction
of
the
oceanic
crust
.

However
,
the
breakdown
between
him
and
Linares
and
the
discontinuation
of
the
progressive
line
provoked
the
Revolution
of
Vindication
which
overthrew
him
in
1879
.

Under
his
administration
,
the
female
vote
was
approved
,
political
parties
were
legalised
,
all
of
the
exiled
were
allowed
to
return
and
the
remaining
political
prisoners
were
freed
.

The
collapse
of
and
intervention
in
dozens
of
banks
lead
to
a
flight
of
capital
,
causing
businesses
to
go
bankrupt
.

It
is
the
portion
from
this
second
boundary
up
to
the
outer
boundary
,
the
imaginary
line
that
connects
the
lighthouse
landmark
at
Punta
del
Este
to
the
lighthouse
landmark
at
Punta
Rasa
.

Things
started
to
change
in
October
1777
when
British
forces
under
the
command
of
General
John
Burgoyne
surrendered
in
Saratoga
in
the
north
of
the
state
of
New
York
.

This
was
the
coup
de
grâce
and
encouragement
the
settlers
needed
to
get
their
independence
.

Indians
arrived
from
Canada
,
led
by
Joseph
Brant
;
they
supported
the
British
because
the
colonists
were
expropriating
more
and
more
of
their
lands
.

The
expedition
was
led
by
General
Joseph
Burgoyne
who
intended
to
reach
Albany
.

However
,
they
were
intercepted
and
had
to
do
battle
in
Freeman
,
close
to
the
Hudson
River
.

Golden
Age
Spanish
or
Early
Modern
Spanish
is
the
variant
of
the
language
that
constitutes
the
transition
from
Medieval
Spanish
to
Modern
Spanish
.

On
the
other
hand
,
external
history
contains
references
to
the
history
of
Spanish
speakers
,
their
historical
vicissitudes
and
the
social
use
of
the
language
.

Nonetheless
,
if
the
English
law
had
been
accepted
,
the
daughters
of
Luis
X
,
Felipe
V
and
Carlos
IV
would
have
had
more
of
a
claim
to
the
throne
,
above
their
aunt
Isabella
of
France
.

The
attempts
at
making
peace
finally
ended
in
spring
of
1415
and
Enrique
decided
to
execute
his
plan
:
an
invasion
of
the
entire
Kingdom
of
France
.

He
also
discussed
the
federalization
of
the
City
of
Buenos
Aires
,
the
extension
of
the
commercial
code
and
the
appointment
of
new
generals
to
the
army
.

In
1976
he
met
with
a
friend
who
worked
with
his
record
label
The
Rocket
Record
Company
,
Kiki
Dee
,
to
record
what
would
be
another
remarkable
success
for
him
:
"
Do
n't
Go
Breaking
My
Heart
"
.

Pompey
took
command
of
two
legions
in
Capua
and
began
to
raise
levies
illegally
,
an
act
that
,
as
was
predictable
,
took
advantage
of
the
Caesarians
who
were
in
his
favor
.

César
was
personally
informed
of
Pompey
's
actions
by
Curio
,
who
at
that
time
had
finished
his
term
in
office
.

Meanwhile
,
his
place
in
tribune
was
occupied
by
Marco
Antonio
,
who
held
the
position
until
December
.

But
when
the
Senate
answered
him
definitively
by
prohibiting
him
from
competing
at
the
consolate
and
giving
him
the
option
of
either
withdrawing
his
troops
or
becoming
a
public
enemy
,
he
understood
that
,
whatever
alternative
he
chose
,
he
would
surrender
unarmed
into
the
hands
of
his
political
enemies
.

On
the
1st
January
49
BC
,
Marco
Antonio
read
a
declaration
from
Caesar
in
which
the
proconsul
declared
himself
a
friend
of
peace
.
